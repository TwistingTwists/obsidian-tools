13 years of brutally honest business advice

#### sell to rich (quality) or poor (volume)
- rich person : half the time, double the money
	- time (give me money and have it tomorrow), reputation (risk - perception of guarantee), effort and sacrifice


#### lack priorities, not information

- where you are, where you want to go, what is obstacle?
- if they can't tell you the mterics. they won't do it.
	- e.g. Finance - cost cutting / improving every 30d 
		- CFO is a decision role. you make decision based on data. decision to give max RoI on capital - money + human.
	- e.g. Sales director -- improve avg closing percentage, leads closed etc 
- WHEN hiring - take a lot of interview - meet people 
	- so that you can know the metrics used to drive outcomes for a given role 
	- quality + quantity 
	- what they do to influence those metrics
	- how does business make from what you do?

#### your standards are too low.

- your best talent is not hired yet.
- if you have dumb rules, (obvious), then you have hired wrong people.


### Lots of rules mean you have dumb people

- Every person you hire raises the bar of the team they get hired into.
- think of 'before the person' and 'after the person' era 

Who is right for the programming role?
- who has written a lot of code before.

Your leadership must not be clueless. like marketing at wiz. Haven't done marketing but beein
