### Knowledge and Insights
  
World -> (  >=1 SUCT )

WH -> Tank (1 UCT + n CT)  + Pool (>=1  of any type {FP, CP, UCP} )
UCT -> SUCT or UCP


  

Tank::UCT = uncapped

Tank::S = standalone (can exist outside a warehouse) 

  

Tank:SUCT => standalone uncapped tank.

  

  
### Approaches
1. Ecto based (using Ash which enables process based  {ets based}  persistence)
2. Building Graph and using graph algorithms to check circularity 
3. preparing our own dsl based on constraints and rules (using Ash)
4. using Tablex - decision table rules
  

Scope 

  

1. Share projects = old and new 
2. Create a brand new repo 

1. Set of modules — logical circularity modules 
2. Define inputs and shape of them 
3. Pass the test. 
4. Context module / modules \

  

Communication channels — slow and fast. 

  

  

  

Looking at quality design and tests. Questions being asked. Decisions and tradeoffs being documented? 

  

TDD.
