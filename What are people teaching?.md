[3 Day AI Coding Accelerator by Vignesh Mohankumar and Jason Liu on Maven](https://maven.com/nila/ai-coding-accelerator)
- **Synchronous workflows** — coding live with AI, structuring state and context, getting clean and correct code out of models.

- **Asynchronous workflows** — background jobs, automated agents, Slack triggers, multi-step processes that run while you focus on something else.

And we cover everything that surrounds coding, too:

- **Design-doc generation** from meeting notes
- **Debugging** with AI
- **PR review** workflows
- **Custom commands, sub-agents, rules**
