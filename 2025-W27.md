What do I want?
What actions to take to get what I want? 
- do actions that create results -- focus on this because this can be measured. focus less on 'intentions' etc. They cannot be measured. focus on actions that can get you results
- you have limited time. you cannot waste time!! 


What areas do i need to grow in ?
- better shoulders / eyes / back / 

Where to invest? 
- Why to invest 
	- ***pay ignorance*** debt as fast as humanly possible. This ignorance debt is constant for everyone.
	- take ***action***  with what you know today - action reveals information - do more of it -> if you cannot take action -> go back to step 1 - pay the ignorance debt, read more, take course, write more and take a decision with a deadline. 
		- make sure you measure how much ignorance debt is paid 
- do education + deliberate practice toward an action 

Seasons for learning / seasons of earning
- advice for self: focus on your season of learning - -get into big leagues - bunch of smart  people who are doing what you want to do. no money. just learn. and then go become director of creative. 
- most expensive thing for you - information you should know, but don't!!
	- what should you have knowm 10 years ago to do things differently today?  - change the financial outcome, material outcome, physical
- debt of ignorance -- BRAND and PRODUCT
	- product is good enough, people will do the marketing and sales for you. the ones which are beter than you. much better. 
- story of 100m offers - make a document for yourself. and MAKE IT GOOD. as a self note. write it for yourself. 
	- good product - too good to fail, too big to fail
	- more time spent on building the product (10 iterations!!) - getting all the insights into the product would unlock more--- moooore things. "obsess over users' love."
	- lots of details to be uncovered in good to great. be great.  8-9 = 10x , 9-9.5 = 10x, 9.9 - 9.9 = 10x
	- spend 1000 hours on a topic. track it. 1000 is top 1%. simple. 
	- In a crowded (commoditized) market - there are outsized returns to being number 1. Simply outsized.
- BRAND
	- what people learn to associate my brand with? - tangible and intangible idea associate with BRAND
	- value that brand shows  
	- build trust - easily. and then your existing customer want to buy that. absolutely. 
		- make promise. overdeliver. consistently. overdeliver.
- delivering exceptional product (or service)  + exceptional reputation around your products (brand) --- 100x more leverage.

cut friends - who talk about past, not future. 
who has most aligned interest with you? -- future you.

For vertexcover - to be an absolutely stunning service business - in AI -- what needs to be true?

**Three layers of security** 
- observability in llm 
- agents - actions  and trust graph -- did they take the right action  (attack suface clasficiatoin -- map it to known risk and guardrails ) -- LLM trust graph 
- TRUST GRAPH  



- prompt interceptor - classify

Here are the steps


### way 001 
- [ ] deploy with old version
- [ ] add schema metadata field and serde default 
- [ ] re deploy

```bash
The replica returned a rejection error: reject code CanisterError, reject message Error from Canister bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai: Canister called `ic0.trap` with message: Failed to restore stable state: Custom(Fail to decode argument 0

Caused by:
    Subtyping error: Type mismatch at /home/abhishek/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/candid-0.10.10/src/de.rs:994)
Canister Backtrace:
ic_cdk::api::trap
estate_backend::post_upgrade
ic_cdk::futures::spawn
canister_post_upgrade

```

### way 002
- old version deploy
- schema metadata with Option 
- re deploy
- done


- add payment_id_v2 field: String and write migration 
- update the post_upgrade hook method
- re deploy (does not work )
```bash
Installing canisters...

.

```

### way 003 

- old code deeploy
- change pre_upgrade and post_upgrade to use ciborium, like yral does.
This is a two step migration 
1. pre_upgrade (ciborium) + post_upgrade (old)
2. pre_upgrade (ciborium) + post_upgrade (ciborium)


##### Way two

way 003-001 
- add schema in canister state 
- let migrationEngine run in post_upgrade hook


way 003-002
- run schema migration for payment_v2 field.
	- test with payment_id: 0 (done)
	- test with payment_id: 98989 (pending)
l
##### Way one
