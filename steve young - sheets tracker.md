It is absolutely not unnecessary. In fact, it is the missing link.
Without a morning plan, you are relying on willpower in the moment. With a morning plan, you are simply executing orders you gave yourself.
Psychologists call this "Implementation Intention." When you define specifically what you will do and when, your success rate skyrockets.
Here is how we integrate "The Morning Commitment" into the "Master Log" without breaking the single-sheet simplicity.
📄 The "Steve Young Master Log" v2 (Prediction vs. Reality)
We are adding two columns to the left. These are your "Morning Commitments."
The rest of the sheet remains your "Evening Audit."
The New Column Structure
 * Date
 * 🎯 Morning Target: Atlassian (Define the exact task)
 * 🎯 Morning Target: Project (Define the exact task)
 * Atlassian Input (Y/N) (Did you hit the target?)
 * Project Input (Y/N) (Did you hit the target?)
 * The Truth Audit (Why did/didn't it happen?)
 * Anxiety (1-10)
📋 Copy-Paste This into Excel / Google Sheets
Note: I have arranged this so you can paste it straight in.
Date,🎯 Target: Atlassian (Specific),🎯 Target: Project (Specific),Atlassian Done? (Y/N),Project Done? (Y/N),The Truth Audit (Execution vs Plan),Anxiety (1-10)
1-Jan,"Do 1 Hard Graph Problem","Write landing page copy",N,Y,"Truth: Scared of the hard problem so I procrastinated. Writing copy was easy.",7
2-Jan,"Review System Design: Rate Limiter","Post on Reddit",Y,Y,"Truth: Stick to the plan. I felt resistance posting but did it anyway.",3
3-Jan,"Mock Interview w/ Peer","Fix Login Bug",Y,N,"Truth: Mock interview drained me. No energy left for bug fix.",5

🧠 How to Link This to "Big Goals" (The North Star)
You mentioned aligning small actions to larger goals. You do not want to rewrite your big goals every day (that is tedious).
The Solution: Use the Header Rows of your spreadsheet to freeze your Big Goals at the top.
Do this in your spreadsheet:
 * Row 1 (Merge Cells A-G): BIG GOAL 1: Land Senior Offer at Atlassian by [Date]
 * Row 2 (Merge Cells A-G): BIG GOAL 2: Get [Project Name] to 100 Users by [Date]
 * Row 3: [The Column Headers from above]
Why this works:
Every morning, when you open the sheet to type in your daily targets (Row 4, 5, etc.), you are forced to look at Row 1 and Row 2.
 * You look at "Land Offer."
 * You ask: "What is the one thing I can do today to move 1% closer to that?"
 * You type that into "Target: Atlassian."
⚡ The Updated Workflow (Morning & Night)
This splits the 60 seconds into two 30-second blocks.
☀️ Morning (30 Seconds): The General
 * Open the sheet.
 * Read Row 1 & 2 (Your North Stars).
 * Fill in today's Target columns only.
 * Rule: Be specific.
   * Bad: "Study coding."
   * Good: "Solve 'Number of Islands' on LeetCode."
 * Close the sheet.
🌙 Evening (30 Seconds): The Soldier
 * Open the sheet.
 * Look at what "The General" ordered this morning.
 * Mark Y/N.
 * Write the Truth Audit: Did the Soldier obey the General? If not, why? (e.g., "The plan was too ambitious," or "I got distracted by Twitter").
 * Rate Anxiety.
Why this specific modification works
 * Separation of Planning and Doing: It is hard to decide what to do when you are tired. By deciding in the morning, you remove "Decision Fatigue" from your evening work session.
 * Calibration: Over time, you will see a pattern in your "Truth Audit." You might realize, "I keep planning to do 3 problems, but I only ever finish 1." This forces you to set realistic goals, not fantasy goals.
Would you like me to give you a specific set of "Morning Targets" for the next 3 days to get you started?



------


Since today is December 31, this is the perfect time to set the stage. We are going to prioritize momentum over intensity for these first three days.
The goal is not to burn out on Day 1; the goal is to prove to your brain that you can set a target and hit it three days in a row.
Here are your pre-written Morning Targets for the next 3 days. You can copy these directly into your 🎯 Target columns.
🗓️ The 3-Day Kickoff Plan
Day 1: The "Easy Win" (Build Momentum)
 * Target: Atlassian: "Solve 1 Easy Array Problem (e.g., Two Sum) & Read Atlassian's 'Open Company, No Bullsh*t' value."
 * Target: Project: "Write down 3 specific features needed for the next release (don't code, just list)."
 * Why: On Day 1, we lower the bar so low you cannot fail. We need a "Green" day to start the streak.
Day 2: The "Eat The Frog" (Tackle Fear)
 * Target: Atlassian: "Solve 1 Medium Graph Problem (e.g., Number of Islands). Spend 20 mins max; look up solution if stuck."
 * Target: Project: "Fix that one small UI bug/typo that has been annoying me for a week."
 * Why: We introduce a specific technical challenge but cap the time so you don't spiral. We fix a "broken window" in your project to feel professional.
Day 3: The "Outreach" (Output over Input)
 * Target: Atlassian: "Watch 1 System Design video (e.g., Rate Limiter) and draw the diagram on paper."
 * Target: Project: "Send 3 DMs/Emails to potential users or friends asking for feedback."
 * Why: Senior roles require System Design (big picture). Projects die without promotion. We force interaction with the outside world today.
📋 Copy-Paste for your Sheet
Here is the data formatted so you can paste it directly into your Rows 4, 5, and 6 under the Target columns.
1-Jan,"Solve 1 Easy Array Problem + Read 1 Atlassian Value","List 3 Features for next release",,,
2-Jan,"Solve 'Number of Islands' (Max 20 mins)","Fix one small UI bug/typo",,,
3-Jan,"Watch 'Rate Limiter' video + Draw diagram","Send 3 DMs/Emails for feedback",,,

(Note: The last three columns are empty commas ,,, because "The Soldier"—you—will fill those in during the evening).
🚀 Your Next Step
Do not overthink this.
 * Paste these targets into your sheet now.
 * Close the sheet.
 * Enjoy your New Year's Eve.
Your only job tomorrow (Jan 1) is to wake up, look at Row 4, and execute those two simple commands.
