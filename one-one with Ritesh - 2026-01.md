#### since last call 

	- improved on testing + documenting - leaving no stones unturned. speed is not my strength. this can be.
	- took care of feedback - docs better + working style improved (quickly wirting down pointers so that I don't rely on my memory) + presenting google sheet on dialogue generation better. 

#### Where company needs hlep? 
	
	- Was writing about notch - not doing an ai video editing - except sceneflow  - so what do we want to pitch ?
		- this depends only on notch raising 20m usd -> then you have a story to tell. otherwise, there is no story. 
		- Recording video on sceneflow - the evals in google sheet - want to get it out by weekend. more linkedin stuff needed for this. 
	
	- few fronts
		- Culture adoption (daily updates) -- async work -- in tuesday meetings. and personal messages.
		- Feedback form - are they learning what are they interested in? -- competence matrix internally -- so that we know that 6 months from now we have better human capital planning -
			- what 1 new area you want to explore and what new capability you aim to gain in that direction -- in next month?  and how can I support you for that? 
		- culture of writing is missing.
#### Where I need help?

	- Making impact - what are the tips / focus areas for me that I m lacking? - in vco and notch 
	- vco - sales pitch - i have started preparing and then i had few realisations. (see below)

ending discussion:
- [ ] Do you think our current progress is in good shape? 
- [ ] What are my next improvement areas? want to focus on working with me as a pleasant experience - what are you irritation points? -- especially since we are async, 
> if i can name it , i can improve it.
