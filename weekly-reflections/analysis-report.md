| Jan 28 | Wed | 3 | Light |
| Jan 29 | Thu | 5 | Medium |
| Jan 30 | Fri | 1 | (Partial) |

### Time Block Analysis
| Time Block | Commits | % of Total | Assessment |
|------------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Morning (6-12)** | 22 | 50% | 🌟 PEAK PERFORMANCE |
| Evening (18-24) | 14 | 32% | Good sustained work |

## 📁 PHASE 2: CONTENT EVOLUTION

### File Categories Modified
| Category | File Changes | Unique Files | Focus Level |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Other Notes | 118 | 88 | 📝 General knowledge capture |

| AI Conversations | 14 | 11 | 🤖 Workflow support |
| Daily Tracking | 3 | 2 | 📅 Progress monitoring |

### Mistakes Folder Evolution
**Most Iterated Files** (showing active learning):
1. `94_binary_tree_inorder.md` - 3 revisions (iterating on understanding)
2. `postorder_traversal_stack_initialization.md` - 2 revisions
3. `797_dfs_path_backtracking.md` - 2 revisions (mastering backtracking)

**New Mistakes Documented**:

- 547_provinces_graph_dfs.md (Graph DFS)
- 1971_validPath.md

### Graph Mastery Progress
**Completed** ✅ (4/10):
- LC 1971 - Find if Path Exists (DFS template mastered)
- LC 797 - All Paths (Backtracking + reference copying)
- LC 547 - Number of Provinces (DFS on adjacency matrix)
- LC 695 - Max Area of Island (Grid DFS)

**In Progress** 🔄:
- LC 1091 - Shortest Path in Binary Matrix (BFS introduction)

**Pending** ⏳ (6 problems):
- LC 542, 1162, 994, 286, 1765 (BFS, Multi-source, Advanced)

## ✅/⚠️ PHASE 3: GOOD vs BAD IDEAS

### ✅ GOOD PATTERNS (Keep Doing)

1. **Mistake Documentation System**
   - 8 distinct mistakes documented this week
   - Pattern: Problem → Mistake → Why → Fix → Key Lesson
   - Shows meta-learning (learning about learning)

2. **Consistent Morning Work**
   - 50% of activity in morning hours
   - Natural alignment with cognitive peak performance
   - Quality > quantity approach

3. **Focused Domain Learning**
   - Not scattered across random topics
   - Deep dive into Graph algorithms (DFS → BFS progression)
   - Building pattern recognition systematically

4. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Files like `94_binary_tree_inorder.md` edited 3 times
   - Shows you revisit and improve understanding
   - Not just capture-and-forget

5. **Progress Tracking Infrastructure**
   - Using Obsidian + git for knowledge management
   - Automated vault backups ensure no lost work
   - Clear roadmap in "Graph Mastery - Question Path.md"

### ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. **Too Many Auto-Commits vs Content**
   - 43/44 commits are vault backups (98%)
   - Only 1 substantial content commit visible
   - *Question*: Are you committing intentional work?

2. **Scattered Evening Sessions**
   - 14 evening commits but fragmented
   - No sustained 2+ hour deep work blocks
   - *Suggestion*: Protect 1-2 evening slots for deep focus

3. **Weekend Over-Activity**
   - Sunday (Jan 25) = 12 commits
   - No clear rest boundary
   - *Risk*: Burnout pattern if sustained

4. **Low Afternoon Utilization**
   - Only 16% of work happens 12-18
   - Could be energy dip or meetings
   - *Opportunity*: Schedule lighter tasks here

5. **Pending Pile Growing**
   - 6/10 problems still pending
   - Pattern: Start strong, finish weak?
   - *Action needed*: Close out LC 1091 before starting new ones

## 🧠 PHASE 4: SELF-REFLECTION PROMPTS

### For Your Journal/Thinking:

**Temporal Awareness**:
- _"I do my best work in the morning (50% of commits). How can I protect more morning hours for LC problems?"_
- _"My evening work is fragmented. Am I tired, distracted, or context-switching too much?"_
- _"I worked heavily on Sunday (12 commits). Was this intentional catch-up or lack of weekend boundaries?"_

**Learning Effectiveness**:
- _"I've documented 8 mistakes this week. Do I feel like I'm making fewer repeated errors?"_
- _"I've revisited `94_binary_tree_inorder.md` 3 times. What made me come back? Incomplete understanding?"_
- _"4 LC problems completed out of 10 planned. Is this pace satisfying or frustrating?"_

**System Health**:
- _"98% of my commits are auto-backups. Am I tracking real progress or just activity?"_
- _"My Obsidian config changed 54 times. Am I optimizing the tool or avoiding the work?"_
- _"I have 6 pending problems. What blocks me from finishing what I start?"_

**Energy & Sustainability**:
- _"Tuesday (Jan 27) was my peak day (13 commits). What made that day different?"_
- _"Wednesday-Thursday dropped significantly (3-5 commits). What happened? Recovery or distraction?"_
- _"If I continue this pace, will I burn out or plateau?"_

### Patterns to Validate:

1. **The Morning Advantage**: Your data proves morning = best time. Are you respecting this?
2. **The Completion Gap**: You start strong but leave 60% pending. Why?
3. **The Tool vs Work Balance**: 54 config changes vs 12 mistake docs. Ratio feels off?
4. **The Sunday Spike**: 27% of weekly work on one day. Sustainable?

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT WEEK

### 1. Temporal Optimization
- **Protect mornings**: Block 2-3 hours 8-11 AM for LC problems only
- **Afternoon pivot**: Use 12-18 for lighter tasks (reviews, docs, planning)
- **Evening constraint**: Max 1 hour, or skip entirely for rest

### 2. Completion Focus
- **Rule**: Don't start LC 994/542 until LC 1091 is ✅
- **Target**: Finish at least 2 more from pending list (suggest 1091 + 994)
- **Method**: Use your documented mistakes to avoid repeated errors

### 3. Commit Quality
- **Intentional commits**: Make at least 5 manual commits with meaningful messages
- **Review pattern**: End each day with a "reflection" note on what worked/didn't

### 4. Sustainability Check
- **Rest day**: Pick one day with ZERO commits (or max 1)
- **Session length**: Try one 2-hour deep work block, measure quality vs quantity

## 📈 WEEKLY SCORECARD

| Metric | Score | Target | Gap |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| LC Problems Completed | 4 | 6 | -2 |
| Mistakes Documented | 8 | 5 | +3 ✅ |
| Morning Utilization | 50% | 60% | -10% |
| Deep Work Sessions (2+ hrs) | 0 | 3 | -3 |
| Config vs Content Ratio | 54:12 | 10:20 | Too much config |
| Rest Day Present | ❌ | 1 | Missing |

**Overall Assessment**: Solid learning infrastructure, excellent morning productivity, but completion rate and work-life balance need attention.
