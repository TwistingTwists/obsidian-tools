DH = average of 10 years 

PB ratio = indicator of book value

long term of PB ratio does not change a lot 
Long term PB ratio (moving average) =  PB ratio will converge to that 
difference between current and average   = log(current / avg)

For index, book value is slow moving (5 yr ish) ,but price is volatile

PE ratio = price / earnings
PEG ratio =
(earnings is volatile number)


Techincals = regression to the mean and mean exists
stock is expected to RISE. The moving average has to rise. this increasing price has to be adjusted to something.

Book value = more stable indicator (book value) in PE ratio

- Roadmap -- compilation issues on rust??
	- BIG goals?
	- Developer docs --- HOW to guides are less.
		- if a company is using your product , what would be the most jaw dropping example of your product TODAY 
	- kapa.ai --- for generating relevant answers from docs
	- testing suite -- boundary studio -- sqlite database for all trials -- test suite for evals stuff 
- Two way binding :
	- proc-macro <-> baml file 
	- clients 
		- Stream structs??
		- Validators in rust 
	- Tool calling?



Relevant experience 

- instructor_ex 
- Rust api clients - stream + chat 
- grafana + victoria metrics + prometheous + flink
