- Roadmap -- compilation issues on rust??
	- BIG goals?
	- Developer docs --- HOW to guides are less.
		- if a company is using your product , what would be the most jaw dropping example of your product TODAY 
	- kapa.ai --- for generating relevant answers from docs
	- testing suite -- boundary studio -- sqlite database for all trials -- test suite for evals stuff 
- Two way binding :
	- proc-macro <-> baml file 
	- clients 
		- Stream structs??
		- Validators in rust 
	- Tool calling?



Relevant experience 

- instructor_ex 
- Rust api clients - stream + chat 
- grafana + victoria metrics + prometheous + flink


Ideal interface for structured output generation

```rust
