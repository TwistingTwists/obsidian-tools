[[What do you want?]]
	* At some point in the future, how much better you get will just be a function of how badly you want it and how much you enjoy the act.
* Mike Tyson once said, "If you're favored by God, you're also favored by the devil." It's alright to strive for greatness, but it's equally important to choose goodness. Don't neglect your loved ones for work; time is fleeting. Appreciate people and sincerely express your love for them. Grief is the result of unexpressed love, and the key to avoiding grief is to love abundantly.
* a man is as good as his heart. 
	* Sthapit hona hai. Pragya jagi rahe.

*  Project I have been doing reflect one of my key character traits. -- keep 'somethings' hushy. They can't be public.
	* have translated 'need not be public' =>  " can't be public"  unconsciously.
	* 'need not be public' => good work. But can be kept quiet. It is like morning sun, which you don't see but sines light everywhere.
	* "can't be public =>  i believe there is a deficiency and hence hesitant to lay it open to everyone. "
* Anushilan: 
	* during meditation - submit the practice to Patanjali. as a service, as a request to make it successful
