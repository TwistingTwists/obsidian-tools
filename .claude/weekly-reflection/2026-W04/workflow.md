# Weekly Self-Reflection Analysis Workflow

## Purpose
Analyze last week's repo activity to facilitate self-reflection on productivity patterns, good/bad ideas, and time management.

## Data Sources
1. **Git commit history** (last 7 days): 43 commits found
2. **File modification patterns**: Which files evolved most
3. **Temporal activity data**: When you worked throughout the week
4. **Content analysis**: Actual changes in key files (mistakes/, progress docs, etc.)

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Activity Pattern Analysis
**Goal**: Understand WHEN you work best
- **Action**: Parse commit timestamps by:
  - Day of week (Mon-Sun)
  - Time blocks (morning 6-12, afternoon 12-18, evening 18-24, night 0-6)
  - Session length (consecutive commits = session)
- **Output**: Heat map of productive hours + session patterns

### Phase 2: Content Evolution Analysis
**Goal**: Understand WHAT you worked on
- **Action**: 
  - Categorize files by type (mistakes/, learning docs, projects, notes)
  - Extract actual content changes from top modified files
  - Track file evolution (initial create → iterations → final state)
- **Output**: Content categories + evolution timeline

### Phase 3: Quality Assessment
**Goal**: Identify good vs bad ideas
- **Action**:
  - Review `mistakes/` folder entries (what went wrong & why)
  - Analyze commits with "fix", "refactor", "update" vs "feat", "add", "create"
  - Look for abandoned files (created but not updated)
  - Check for duplicate/similar work
- **Output**: 
  - ✅ **Good patterns**: Consistent documentation, mistake tracking, iterative improvement
  - ⚠️ **Areas to improve**: Scope creep, abandoned ideas, time-of-day mismatches

### Phase 4: Self-Reflection Synthesis
**Goal**: Generate reflection prompts
- **Action**: Cross-reference patterns with actual content
- **Output**: 
  - What worked well this week?
  - What would you do differently?
  - Optimal time blocks for specific work types
  - Focus areas for next week

## Key Questions We'll Answer

1. **Temporal Patterns**
   - What days were most productive?
   - What time blocks yield best focus?
   - Are there consistent "deep work" sessions?

2. **Work Quality**
   - How many mistakes documented vs fixed?
   - Are you iterating or abandoning ideas?
   - What's the ratio of consumption vs creation?

3. **Focus Areas**
   - Graph mastery progress (LC problems attempted)
   - Mistake pattern trends
   - Learning documentation quality

## Expected Artifacts
1. Activity timeline visualization (text-based)
2. Good ideas / Bad ideas summary table
3. Self-reflection prompt sheet
4. Recommendations for next week

## Agreed Approach
Once you approve this workflow, I'll:
1. Execute Phase 1-4 sequentially
2. Present findings with specific data points
3. Generate reflection questions based on YOUR patterns
4. Not proceed without your approval of methodology
