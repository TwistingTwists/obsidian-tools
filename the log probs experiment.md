Hypothesis: 

if you can logprobs, there are a few experiemnts you can run. 

1. knowing when the  modles lie. 
2. 2. basic hypothesis is - if the logprobs are consistently low fo a series of tokens, or the keyword that you are looking an answer for -- lying

3. implementing the research paper by paras to see if the LLMs 
I want fame, hence I am ineterested in this a little more. 

so, implement the log probs + as the tokens are streamed, atkea a running sum / average of the log probs and stop at 84%. sort of running window.s
