- [ ] TEMPLATE BUILDER linkages
	- [ ] one to many is fine 
	- [ ] A -> B -> C -> D
- [ ] save user_prompt as a part of VTC
- [ ] model + provider+ user_prompt + parent references (url + video_template_collection_id) 
- [ ] delete videoTemplateCollection -> set status  = archived (soft delete)
- [ ] 
- [ ] Admin tool -> generate sora -> user can navigate away and still see the video 
- [ ] csv in prod 
	- [ ] for every video in arcads -> create two variants in 'draft' mode -> sora video saving as template if they like
- [ ] arcads url -> generate sora video -> ability to remix (raw without enriching the user_prompt via llm calls)
	- [ ] api for remix testing -> turn off the llm call and internal remixing 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 12 seconds mark is missing from videos
- [ ] mark template as public or private 
- [ ] inserting template
