Donate to charity => In exchange, I will train you. 
1. do a good job. ask money.
2. Do it for free for first 5-10 times. Figure out the system. and then scale that up to 5000 lcotions

Why?
1. free -> paid 
2. referrals 
3. testimonials, reviews
4. do it free in exchange for ***feedback*** from free customers.
