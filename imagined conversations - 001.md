"Yesterday, my wife asked me to book movie tickets. Last evening, she visited her mother. Today, she asked me to cancel the tickets, saying she wasn't feeling well. I care about her and want to understand if there might be another reason behind the cancellation, possibly related to her visit yesterday, without making her feel pressured or accused."

Okay, this requires a gentle approach. You want to understand, not accuse. The key is to center your concern on her well-being and open the door for her to share more if she feels comfortable, without making her defensive.

Here are a few options for your next question, depending on the nuance you want:

**Option 1 (Focus on her well-being, gently linking the visit):**

> "Hey honey, I'm sorry you're not feeling well enough for the movie today. Is everything okay? Just wondering if maybe the visit to your mom's yesterday evening tired you out, or if something came up there? No pressure to talk if you don't feel like it, just checking in."

- **Why it works:** Starts with care ("sorry you're not feeling well"). Links the visit gently ("wondering if maybe..."). Offers an "out" ("no pressure"). Focuses on her potential tiredness or if something external "came up."
    

**Option 2 (More direct about the change of plans, still compassionate):**

> "Okay, honey, thanks for letting me know about cancelling. I know you wanted to go yesterday. Is it just that you're physically not feeling up to it, or is there anything else on your mind, maybe since your visit last night? Just want to make sure you're alright."

- **Why it works:** Acknowledges the change ("I know you wanted to go"). Directly asks if it's just physical or if there's "anything else." Connects it potentially to the visit ("maybe since..."). Ends with concern ("make sure you're alright").
