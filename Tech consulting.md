1. WHO to consult? -- companies who have internal engg team, but not a big Data Science team 
2. write a book on management playbook -- which you have run 5-6 times. 
	1. Consulting is a good way to test the book

#### Generate leads and find leads? 
- Audience: VC, pre-seed  / seed funded companies
	- small companies hitting scaling issues
	- ABC KPI will be unlocked in a business.
- message: I'll get you seed funding.
- platform


#### Affiliates 
- have "head of AI" folks. I'd like to see if I can help you out.
- linkedin search -> 2nd degree connection => to get you an intro to the people.

#### blogpost 

organic content gets you equity. 
Sometimes, blogs take 5 days to write. 

none of the blogpost mention that I am a consultant.


Value extraction: from the content.

-- if you only write DEEP technical blogposts - you can get good contract / technical work. LIke a 

- " 3 things AI did, optimizing pytorch model " -- why doesn't fb hire you?! --
- 


Aim of blogpost : bring credibility to the audience. Write to build that.
if you are VP : you are not finding great consultants via ad. but you find great courses / free content to find this guy. 
"Who is this guy?": VP


Technical + strategic content 

How you want to be shared?
- as one who gets problems solved


Highest conversion way is (for me as a consultant VP ): 
1. my team has read blogs => come work for me! 
2. two blogs --- that get 40k views! -- work for you 

Are problems I am seeing -- are those problems I want to solve? 
- do I want to recruiting business?
- book writing business
- 10% of what I save your business?

- Which business is a good business to be in?
- Can you create a content creation agency without me being face of it?
	- 20% margin, 4hrs every week of feedback?



##### charge more 

1. Accountable to outcome: 
2. Internally believe your own rate. 
	1. recently with 
3. Ask better questions to get better price 
	1. what is at-stake in your business? => loosing money because of A
	2. What you think you can gain by deploying this solution? => get series-B
	3. What are you willing to invest to open TAM by 20% / improve conversion of funnel ? 
4. if you are selling a list of tasks 
	1. You get stuck in hourly rate
	2. Some folks want PoC => seed : extra things / effort to make you successful. I want to be a part of success.
		1. Value prop: find team / designers + i can build PoC + i can find team build PoC + deliver results
	3. 


My problem:
- Prefer hourly rate stuff because accountability.
- I think that I can earn money. But I don't want to be help accountable
	- PRACTICE - do what you say. Integrity has a lot of money in it. 


#### Cautions
- on taking too much too soon.
- being TOOO much available
- not being mindful of time boundaries

##### Sample blog post 

- These are the PAINS (anxieties) when making decisions about data science in new teams.


> once you have an audience + message => accomplish a dream , alleviate message. Monetize it. 


##### size of consultancy 

- People pay me because I am hard to find. I have 10yoe experience. How do you train other folks ?
- 



##### Playbook for upskilling 

you have to be in trenches. 


#### asset mindset 

- you are not trading time for money. 
	- If you work 2x => get paid 2x. Do build the capital base and let it compound with time.


### Tools 
- motion AI -- make booking links to a lot of people -- set rules to ensure CHILLING
