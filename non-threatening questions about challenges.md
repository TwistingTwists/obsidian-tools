Okay, let's frame the "What's fun / not fun" approach within five scenarios typical of a Senior Manager's interactions at Google. The key is using it not just for performance issues, but for general engagement, alignment, and well-being checks.

**Assumptions:**
*   **Google Context:** Fast-paced, project-oriented, emphasis on impact, psychological safety is valued (at least ideally), matrixed reporting/collaboration is common.
*   **Senior Manager Role:** Oversees multiple teams or a significant functional area, focuses on strategy, removes blockers, develops talent, ensures team health.

**Scenario 1: Checking In With a High-Performing Tech Lead Post-Launch**

*   **Context:** Aisha is a stellar TL who just led her team through a demanding but successful product launch (e.g., a new feature in Google Search). She put in long hours. You want to gauge her state and ensure sustainability.
*   **Conversation (in a 1:1):**
    *   **You (Sr. Manager):** "Aisha, fantastic work on the launch. The metrics look great, and the team really delivered under pressure. Now that the dust is settling a bit, I wanted to check in on *you*. Looking back at the intense period, and even thinking about the day-to-day now, what parts of the work leading up to it, or even your current tasks, are feeling genuinely energizing or fun for you? And conversely, what aspects felt like a real grind, or maybe aren't that engaging right now?"
    *   **Aisha (Hypothetical):** "Thanks! It feels good to have it out. Honestly, the *problem-solving* under pressure was kind of thrilling, and seeing the team pull together was awesome. That part was 'fun' in a challenging way. What's *not* fun right now is the mountain of post-launch bug triage and documentation cleanup – it feels less strategic, and I'm itching to think about the *next* big thing."
    *   **Your Follow-up:** "Got it, that makes sense. The adrenaline rush followed by the cleanup slump. Let's talk about how we can distribute some of that triage work more effectively across the team so you can start dedicating cycles to V2 planning. Maybe pair up a junior engineer with you on the docs for a learning opportunity? We need your strategic brain freed up, but also need to ensure the launch is fully stabilized."

**Scenario 2: A Team Member Seems Disengaged or Less Vocal**

*   **Context:** Ben is a solid engineer, usually contributes actively in design discussions, but has been quieter lately. His core deliverables are okay, but the usual proactive engagement isn't there. He's working on a necessary but perhaps less glamorous infrastructure project.
*   **Conversation (in a 1:1):**
    *   **You (Sr. Manager):** "Hey Ben, wanted to check in on how things are going with the [Infra Project Name] work. I know it's critical foundational stuff. Stepping back from the specific tasks for a moment, how are you finding the work overall? What aspects of it, or even other things you're involved in, are you finding interesting or 'fun' these days? And are there parts that feel a bit repetitive or less engaging?"
    *   **Ben (Hypothetical):** "The project's fine, technically interesting in parts... I guess figuring out the new data pipeline optimization was cool. But honestly, it feels a bit disconnected from the end-user impact, which is something I usually enjoy seeing. So, the 'not fun' part is maybe feeling a bit isolated in the infra layer right now."
    *   **Your Follow-up:** "Thanks for sharing that, Ben. That perspective is really valuable. Impact connection is crucial. While this infra piece is vital *for enabling* future user features, maybe we can find ways to increase visibility. How about we schedule a session where the product team shares how this infra work will unlock their next big feature? Or maybe you could spend some '20% time' collaborating on a small feature with a front-end team to stay connected?"

**Scenario 3: Career Development Discussion with a Promising Manager**

*   **Context:** Chloe is a Manager reporting to you, doing well operationally, but you want to ensure she's growing and finding fulfillment as she moves towards Sr. Manager potential.
*   **Conversation (during a career-focused 1:1):**
    *   **You (Sr. Manager):** "Chloe, as we think about your growth trajectory and impact here, I'm curious about your own energy sources. When you look across all the things you do – managing the team, project oversight, stakeholder alignment, technical guidance, hiring – what parts of your role truly energize you, the parts you'd almost call 'fun'? And what aspects, if you're honest, feel more draining or like something you just have to push through?"
    *   **Chloe (Hypothetical):** "That's a good question. I *love* the people development side – coaching my team members, seeing them grow, that's incredibly rewarding, definitely 'fun'. Solving complex cross-functional dependency issues can also be satisfying. What's 'not fun' is probably the sheer volume of routine status reporting and budget tracking – it feels necessary but takes away from the strategic and people stuff."
    *   **Your Follow-up:** "Okay, great insight. Strong alignment between enjoyment and key leadership skills like coaching. For the 'not fun' parts: let's brainstorm ways to streamline or delegate some of that reporting. Could your TLs take more ownership? Are there tools or processes we could improve? Freeing up your time for high-leverage activities is key for your development and the team's success."

**Scenario 4: Integrating a New Team Member After Transfer**

*   **Context:** David transferred into your org from another part of Google (e.g., Ads to Cloud) a couple of months ago. He's technically capable but navigating a new domain and team dynamics. You want to check his assimilation and engagement.
*   **Conversation (in a check-in 1:1):**
    *   **You (Sr. Manager):** "David, now that you've had a bit more time to settle into the team and the [Cloud Project Name] space, I wanted to see how you're finding things. Beyond just getting up to speed, what parts of the work or the team environment here are you finding particularly interesting or enjoyable – maybe even surprisingly 'fun'? And are there any aspects that are proving more challenging or less engaging than you expected?"
    *   **David (Hypothetical):** "The scale of the problems in Cloud is definitely exciting, that's 'fun'. And the team's been welcoming. The 'not fun' part, or maybe just challenging, is the sheer number of internal tools and processes specific to Cloud – it sometimes feels like I spend more time figuring out *how* to do something than actually doing it."
    *   **Your Follow-up:** "Totally understandable, the tooling landscape here *is* vast. Thanks for being candid. Let's make sure you have the right support there. Have you been paired with a buddy effectively? Are the onboarding docs helpful? Maybe we can schedule a dedicated session with one of the senior engineers just to walk through the toolchain for your specific tasks. We want to reduce that friction so you can focus on the interesting problems."

**Scenario 5: Addressing a Missed Deadline or Setback**

*   **Context:** A project sub-team led by Emily missed a milestone. It wasn't catastrophic, but it requires recalibration. You need to understand the root cause without creating a blame culture.
*   **Conversation (in a small group setting or 1:1 with Emily):**
    *   **You (Sr. Manager):** "Okay team / Emily, let's talk about the [Project Feature] milestone. We didn't quite hit the target date, so let's unpack that constructively. Before we dive into specific blockers, I'm curious about the experience of working on this phase. What parts of the development process felt smooth, efficient, maybe even 'fun' or satisfying when things *were* clicking? And what parts felt frustrating, overly complex, or just 'not fun' – the areas where friction seemed highest?"
    *   **Emily / Team (Hypothetical):** "Collaborating on the core algorithm design was really engaging ('fun'). But waiting for dependencies from Team X, and the unexpected complexity in integrating the new API, that was definitely 'not fun' and where we lost the most time. It felt like we were blocked and spinning our wheels."
    *   **Your Follow-up:** "Okay, thanks for pinpointing that. It sounds like the core work within the team was flowing well, but external dependencies and unforeseen integration issues were the main source of friction and delay. That helps focus our problem-solving. Let's discuss strategies for mitigating those dependency risks better next time, and maybe do a deeper dive into the API integration challenges to see what we learned."
