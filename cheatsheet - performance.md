Here is the High-Performance Mindset Cheatsheet based on Steve Young’s section of the MasterClass.
While David Yeager focuses on how to talk to others (mentorship), Steve Young focuses on internal performance psychology—how to handle pressure, anxiety, and "Imposter Syndrome."
As a manager, you use these templates to help employees who are talented but paralyzed by fear, stress, or high expectations.
🧠 STEVE YOUNG: HIGH-LEVEL PRINCIPLES
1. Run Toward the "Spike" (Lean into Fear)
 * Concept: In football, if you shy away from a hit, you get hurt. If you lower your shoulder and run into the tackler, you are safer.
 * Application: Anxiety usually comes from avoidance. The only cure for performance anxiety is to identify exactly what you are afraid of and tackle it head-on immediately.
2. Outcome Detachment
 * Concept: You cannot control the "Score" (the sale, the stock price, the award). You can only control the "Process" (your preparation, your effort).
 * Application: When employees obsess over results ("We have to win this deal!"), they choke. Shift their focus entirely to the inputs ("Did we execute the research step perfectly?").
3. Integration of Anxiety
 * Concept: Nerves aren't a sign you are weak; they are a sign your body is readying itself for something important. Don't try to "calm down." Try to "focus up."
📄 THE PERFORMANCE COACHING TEMPLATES
Use these templates when a team member is stressed, burning out, or afraid of failing.
1. The "Run Toward the Fear" Audit
Goal: To stop an employee from procrastinating due to anxiety.
When to use: When someone is delaying a project or avoiding a difficult phone call.
The Template:
> "I notice we are stalling on [Project/Task]. Usually, when we delay, it’s because we are dreading a specific part of it. Let’s run toward the fear: What is the single worst-case scenario you are imagining right now? Let's name it."
> 
Examples:
 * The Cold Call: "I notice you haven't called the client yet. What's the worst case? They yell at you? Okay, if they yell, we hang up. Now that we've named it, let's dial."
 * The Public Speech: "You're avoiding the rehearsal. Are you afraid of forgetting your lines? Let's practice forgetting your lines right now and see how you recover."
 * The Negotiation: "You're delaying sending the contract. Are you afraid they'll reject the price? Let's roleplay them saying 'No' so you realize it won't kill the deal."
 * The Bad News: "You haven't told the team about the delay. Are you scared they will quit? Let's map out exactly what we do if someone threatens to quit."
 * The Design Review: "You haven't shown me the mockups. Are you scared I'll hate them? Show me the 'worst' one first so we can get the judgment over with."
2. The Process-Over-Outcome Anchor
Goal: To lower the stakes so the employee can perform freely.
When to use: Before a "Big Game" moment (major presentation, launch day, sales pitch).
The Template:
> "I know you are worried about [The Result: winning/losing]. I am taking that off your shoulders. I don't care about the final score right now. I only care about [The Input: your preparation/energy]. If you execute [Specific Process Step] perfectly, I will consider this a win regardless of what the client says."
> 
Examples:
 * The Big Pitch: "I don't care if we sign the contract today. I only care that you ask the 'Budget Question' confidently. If you do that, you succeeded."
 * The Interview: "Don't worry about getting the job. Just focus on explaining your portfolio clearly. If you articulate your story well, that is a win."
 * The Product Launch: "Forget the download numbers. Focus entirely on the server stability checks. If the uptime is 100%, the launch is a success to me."
 * The Difficult Conversation: "Don't worry about whether they agree with you. Just focus on keeping your voice calm and stating your facts. That is your only goal."
 * The Quarter End: "Stop watching the revenue dashboard. Focus on making 10 high-quality calls today. The result will take care of itself."
3. The "Imposter" Reality Check
Goal: To help a newly promoted leader who feels like a fraud (Steve Young replacing Joe Montana).
When to use: When someone steps into a role they feel unqualified for.
The Template:
> "You are feeling like you don't belong in this room because you are comparing your [Current Rookie Status] to everyone else’s [Highlight Reel/Experience]. You aren't supposed to know everything yet. Your job right now isn't to be an expert; it's to be a [Learner/Relentless Worker]."
> 
Examples:
 * New Manager: "You feel weird managing your former peers. You aren't supposed to be a 'boss' yet; you're just supposed to be a facilitator. Focus on removing blocks for them."
 * Young Exec: "You're the youngest person in the boardroom. Don't try to out-strategize the veterans. Your value is your fresh perspective on tech. Lean into that."
 * The Transfer: "You just moved from Sales to Product. Stop trying to act like a Product Manager. Act like a Sales expert learning Product. That is your superpower."
 * The Stretch Project: "You've never run a P&L before. Stop pretending you have. Ask the 'dumb' questions. That is how you learn the fastest."
 * The Replacement: "You are replacing a beloved leader. Don't try to be her. Be the best version of you. We promoted you for your style, not hers."
4. The "Data vs. Drama" Filter
Goal: To stop emotional spiraling.
When to use: When a team member interprets a small failure as a catastrophe.
The Template:
> "You are telling yourself a story that [Dramatic Interpretation]. Let’s look at the tape. What is the actual [Data Point]? Let’s separate the emotion from the evidence."
> 
Examples:
 * The Angry Email: "You think the client hates us (Drama). The data is: They asked for a clarification on line 4 (Data). Let's answer line 4."
 * The Passed Promotion: "You think you have no future here (Drama). The data is: You need to improve your strategic presentation skills (Data). Let's work on that."
 * The Bug: "You think the launch is ruined (Drama). The data is: We found one critical bug in the login flow (Data). Let's fix the login flow."
 * The Silence: "You think the prospect is ghosting us because they found a competitor (Drama). The data is: They haven't replied in 24 hours (Data). People get busy. Follow up."
 * The Critique: "You think I'm disappointed in you (Drama). The data is: I asked you to fix the formatting (Data). Fix the formatting."
5. The Vulnerability Reset
Goal: To build trust by admitting your own uncertainty (Steve Young leading by example).
When to use: When the team is tense and looking to you for perfect answers you don't have.
The Template:
> "I want to be honest with you. I am also feeling [Anxiety/Uncertainty] about [Situation]. I don't have the perfect answer yet. But here is my plan to find it: [Plan]. I need your help to execute this."
> 
Examples:
 * The Layoff Rumors: "I am also anxious about the restructuring rumors. I don't know the final org chart yet. But I plan to update you daily, even if the update is 'no news.'"
 * The Market Crash: "I am also worried about our Q3 targets given the economy. I don't have a magic fix. But I plan to focus us entirely on retaining existing customers."
 * The New Tech: "I honestly don't know how this new AI tool will change our workflow. I'm learning it too. Let's figure it out together this week."
 * The Project Pivot: "I know this pivot is frustrating. I’m frustrated too because we wasted work. But I plan to salvage the code we can and move forward."
 * The Mistake: "I messed up the budget calculation. I am embarrassed about it. Here is how I plan to fix it with Finance, and I need your help to double-check my math."

Here is the Relationship Mindset Cheatsheet adapted from Steve Young’s performance psychology.
In a marriage, "performance anxiety" often looks like walking on eggshells, avoiding difficult topics to keep the peace, or spiraling when things aren't perfect. Steve Young’s principles of leaning into discomfort and focusing on your own inputs are powerful tools for connection.
❤️ RELATIONSHIP MINDSET: THE STEVE YOUNG FRAMEWORK
Core Philosophy:
 * Fear: Avoidance creates distance. Running toward the "spike" (the difficult conversation) creates intimacy.
 * Control: You cannot control her mood or reaction (The Score). You can only control your kindness, patience, and honesty (The Process).
1. The "Run Toward the Spike" Template
Goal: To stop avoiding necessary conflict. In marriage, silence is often more damaging than arguing.
When to use: When you are sensing tension but are afraid to bring it up because you don't want to "ruin the evening."
The Template:
> "I’ve been hesitating to bring up [The Issue] because I was afraid it would lead to [The Fear: a fight/silence/hurt feelings]. But I value our closeness too much to let this sit between us. Can we talk about it?"
> 
Examples:
 * The Budget: "I’ve been avoiding looking at our credit card bill because I’m afraid we overspent. But I value our financial future too much to ignore it. Can we look at it together tonight?"
 * The In-Laws: "I’ve been hesitating to talk about your mom’s visit because I don't want you to think I don't like her. But I need to set some boundaries so I can enjoy the visit too."
 * Intimacy: "I’ve been avoiding initiating sex because I’m afraid of being rejected. But I miss being close to you. Can we talk about how we're feeling lately?"
 * The Chore Gap: "I haven't said anything about the dishes because I don't want to nag. But I'm feeling resentful, and I don't want to feel that way toward you."
 * The Bad Mood: "I notice you're quiet, and I'm scared to ask why because I'm worried I did something wrong. But I want to check in—are we okay?"
2. The Process-Over-Outcome Anchor
Goal: To stop obsessing over "fixing" her or getting a specific reaction (Outcome). Focus only on your behavior (Process).
When to use: When you are frustrated that your efforts (date night, cleaning, gifts) aren't being "rewarded" with the reaction you wanted.
The Template:
> "I am feeling frustrated because I wanted [Outcome: you to be happy/us to have a perfect night]. I’m going to let go of that expectation. My only goal right now is to [Process: be present/listen/be kind], regardless of the mood."
> 
Examples:
 * The Ruined Date Night: "I wanted tonight to be perfect, but the reservation got messed up. I'm letting go of 'perfect.' My only goal now is to enjoy sitting next to you, even if we are just eating pizza."
 * The Venting Session: "I want to fix your problem so you stop crying (Outcome). But I know that's not what you need. My only goal is to listen without offering solutions (Process)."
 * The Apology: "I want her to forgive me right now (Outcome). I can't force that. My only goal is to deliver a sincere apology and give her space (Process)."
 * The Gift: "I wanted her to be thrilled with the present. She isn't. I will not get defensive. My goal was to show I care; I did that. I will focus on understanding why it missed the mark."
 * The Argument: "I want to 'win' this point (Outcome). No. My goal is to understand her perspective (Process). If I understand her, I win."
3. The "Imposter" Reality Check
Goal: To stop comparing your marriage to others or to an idealized past.
When to use: When you feel like a "bad husband" or that your marriage is failing because it isn't perfect.
The Template:
> "I am judging our relationship right now because I am comparing our [Current Reality: messy house/tired parents] to [The Fantasy: Instagram couples/our honeymoon phase]. We aren't supposed to be perfect; we are just supposed to be [The Truth: a team figuring it out]."
> 
Examples:
 * New Parents: "I feel like we are failing because we are snapping at each other. Stop. We are exhausted new parents. We aren't supposed to be romantic right now; we are supposed to be surviving together."
 * The Lull: "I feel bad that we haven't had a 'spark' lately. Stop comparing us to when we were dating. We are building a life. The goal isn't constant excitement; it's stability."
 * The Other Couple: "Bob and Sarah seem so happy. Stop. I don't know their struggles. I only know ours, and I am committed to working on ours."
 * The Career Shift: "I feel like a failure because I'm not providing enough right now. Stop. Marriage is a long game. Right now, she is carrying the load, and later I will carry it. That's partnership."
 * The Misunderstanding: "I feel like I'm bad at communicating. Stop. I am learning how to communicate with her. It takes practice."
4. The "Data vs. Drama" Filter
Goal: To stop misinterpreting her actions and spiraling into negativity.
When to use: When she does something small (sighs, forgets something) and you interpret it as a sign she doesn't love you.
The Template:
> "I am telling myself the story that [The Drama: she doesn't respect me/she is bored of me]. Let’s look at the tape. The only actual data is [The Data: she is on her phone/she forgot to call]. Let's ask about the data before reacting to the drama."
> 
Examples:
 * The Sigh: "She sighed when I walked in. Drama: She hates that I'm home. Data: She let out a breath. Maybe she had a hard day. I'll ask: 'Rough day?'"
 * The Text: "She replied with one word. Drama: She is angry. Data: She sent a short text. Maybe she is driving or busy. I'll wait."
 * The Chore: "She didn't do the laundry. Drama: She expects me to do everything. Data: The laundry isn't done. I'll ask if she needs help or forgot."
 * The Distraction: "She's scrolling while I'm talking. Drama: She finds me boring. Data: She is looking at her phone. I'll say: 'Hey, I'd love your full attention for a sec.'"
 * The Bedtime: "She went to bed early. Drama: She is avoiding intimacy. Data: She is tired. I'll ask how she's feeling."
5. The Vulnerability Reset
Goal: To break the tension by admitting you don't have it all figured out.
When to use: When you are in a stalemate or argument and don't know how to fix it.
The Template:
> "I want to be honest. I am feeling [Emotion: scared/overwhelmed/lost] right now. I don't know the right thing to say to fix this, but I do know that [The Anchor: I love you/I want us to be okay]. Can we start over?"
> 
Examples:
 * The Heated Fight: "I'm feeling really defensive right now. I don't want to fight, but I don't know how to stop. I love you. Can we take a 10-minute break?"
 * The Disconnect: "I feel like we are drifting apart and it scares me. I don't have a plan to fix it yet, but I want to be close to you again. What can we do?"
 * The Big Decision: "I'm terrified about this job change. I'm acting confident for the kids, but I need you to know I'm worried. I need you on my team."
 * The Parenting Clash: "I don't know if I'm being too strict with our son. I feel lost. I know we are arguing, but I just want him to turn out okay. Help me figure this out."
 * The Silent Treatment: "I don't know why I'm shutting down. I think I'm just overwhelmed. I love you, I just need a moment to process before I can talk."
