## Another approach 

- arcads approach - remix sora video 
- veo3 extensions

## Remix a video 
- sora video -- change product / update the video 
	- arcads style 
- split screen - text over screen etc, static + dynamics parts in the template 
- product + avatar = static avatar with background setting ()
- What to build 
	- animation support inside figma plugin (not possible to preview)
	- and convert that to remotion
- What else to BUILD 
	- Transition between scenes need to be allowed
- Template decides whether to animate the element or not 
	- css properties / html properties
	- 'let user' specify json template -- figma animation template -- remotion template 
- b roll types = 3 types 
	- product image b roll -> animated product image 
	- user uploaded b roll 
		- which are most relevant 4 seconds
	- ai generated b roll (NOT a b roll - only scene with voiceover)
	- stock videos as b rolls (find right b roll based on keywords < given by the )
