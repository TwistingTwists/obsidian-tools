Docker offers bridges (NAT), host networking, overlays (for multi-host networks via Kubernetes or Swarm), etc. Well-supported by CNI plugins and network drivers.

LXD can set up a default bridge with NAT, and supports macvlan, physical NIC passthrough, etc. No built-in overlay network for multi-host (requires external setup).
