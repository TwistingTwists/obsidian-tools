_**User (2026-01-25T03:46:54.909Z)**_

in this folder - grep for the filenames - the ones edited in last week -> add tag leetcode to them . 

--
find the files and do that. (see some fiels that already have that tag) 

this is obsidian vault -> so that the tag is in frontmatter ->

The user wants me to:
1. Find files edited in the last week in the current folder (/home/abhishek/Downloads/experiments/learnings)
2. Add a "leetcode" tag to their frontmatter (since this is an Obsidian vault)
3. The user mentions they can see some files that already have that tag

This is a task that involves:
1. Finding files modified in the last week
2. Reading them to check their frontmatter
3. Adding/updating the frontmatter with the leetcode tag

Let me think about whether I need to use a skill first. The user is asking me to:
- Find files by modification date
- Edit files to add tags to frontmatter
- This is an operational task in an Obsidian vault

Looking at the superpowers skills, I don't think there's a specific skill that applies here. This is a straightforward operational task:
1. Use Bash to find files modified in the last 7 days
2. Read each file to see the frontmatter
3. Edit files to add the tag if it's not there

Let me proceed without a skill. I'll:
1. Use Bash to find files modified in last 7 days
2. For each file, read it and add the tag to frontmatter if needed

Actually, let me first find files modified in the last week.

I'll help you add the "leetcode" tag to files edited in the last week. Let me start by finding those files.

Good, I have a list of files. Now I need to:
1. Check each file to see if it has frontmatter with tags
2. Add the "leetcode" tag if it's not there

Let me look at one file first to understand the format.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to be more selective. I should look at the titles of files edited in the last week and only add the "leetcode" tag to those that actually are leetcode-related based on their filenames.

Looking at the files from the earlier find command:
1. Daily worksheet for graphs.md - maybe, but not explicit
2. Stack - leetcode.md - YES, has leetcode in name
3. Grid based graph.md - maybe, but not explicit
4. Intuition for slot fitting.md - not clear
5. Beyond basics of BFS.md - maybe, but not explicit
6. basics cheatsheet.md - maybe, but not explicit
7. Tree - leetcode.md - YES, has leetcode in name
8. BFS LEETCODE.md - YES, has leetcode in name
9. Task scheduler variations.md - maybe leetcode, but not explicit
10. backtracking.md - maybe, but not explicit
11. leetcode DSA patterns.md - YES, has leetcode in name
12. Graph - leetcode.md - YES, has leetcode in name
13. Priority Queue - heap - leetcode.md - YES, has leetcode in name
14. 2026-01-06.md - not leetcode
15. mistakes/94_binary_tree_inorder.md - looks like leetcode (problem number), YES
16. Lenovo IdeaPad.md - NO
17. binary search.md - maybe, but not explicit
18. Beyond basics graph.md - maybe, but not explicit
19. Union find - use cases.md - maybe, but not explicit
20. Stack - monotonic stack.md - maybe leetcode related but not explicit

I should be selective and only add the tag to files that clearly have "leetcode" in the title, or are clearly leetcode-related like the mistakes folder files which have problem numbers.

Files to tag:
- Stack - leetcode.md
- Tree - leetcode.md


- BFS LEETCODE.md
- leetcode DSA patterns.md
- Graph - leetcode.md
- Priority Queue - heap - leetcode.md
- mistakes/94_binary_tree_inorder.md

I'll apply the tag to each of these files individually.

Great! I've successfully added the leetcode tag to 5 files that were edited in the last week and have leetcode in their titles:
1. Stack - leetcode.md
2. BFS LEETCODE.md
3. Graph - leetcode.md
4. Tree - leetcode.md
5. mistakes/94_binary_tree_inorder.md

And I verified that 2 files already had the tag:
- Priority Queue - heap - leetcode.md
- leetcode DSA patterns.md

The task is complete.

Done! I've added the `leetcode` tag to 5 files edited in the last week:

✓ Stack - leetcode.md
✓ BFS LEETCODE.md
✓ Graph - leetcode.md
✓ Tree - leetcode.md
✓ mistakes/94_binary_tree_inorder.md

(Note: Priority Queue - heap - leetcode.md and leetcode DSA patterns.md already had the tag)
