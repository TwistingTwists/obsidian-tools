move all the files tagged leetcode into leetcode-2026-01/
so that they are segregated.

The user wants me to move all files tagged "leetcode" into a folder called "leetcode-2026-01/". 

Let me think about what they're asking:
1. Find all files tagged "leetcode"
2. Move them into a "leetcode-2026-01/" directory

This is a task that involves file operations. Let me check if there's a skill that applies here. Looking at the available skills, I don't see one that directly applies to this simple file organization task. This is pretty straightforward - find files with a specific tag and move them.

However, I should first understand:
1. What "tagged" means - are these files literally tagged (like in a file system), or is this referring to some metadata?
2. The current directory structure

Let me start by exploring the current directory to understand what we're working with. I should use the Bash tool to check the directory structure and see if I can find files related to "leetcode".

I'll help you organize the leetcode files. Let me first explore the current directory structure to find all files tagged with "leetcode".

Good! I found several files with "leetcode" in their names. Now I need to:
1. Create the "leetcode-2026-01/" directory if it doesn't exist
2. Move all these files into that directory

Let me first check the current directory to see if the directory already exists, then create it if needed and move the files.
