# Document Mistake Skill

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Info
- [ ] Problem ID or topic name
- [ ] Buggy code + explanation (extract from context)
- [ ] ⚠️ DO NOT ask for type—auto-detect from code

### 2. Auto-Detect Type
Analyze the mistake and classify:
- **Logic**: Algorithm flaw, wrong condition, incorrect sequence
- **Implementation**: Variable mismatch, wrong reference, state management
- **Edge-case**: Boundary condition, null handling, off-by-one
- **Conceptual**: Misunderstanding of data structure/algorithm behavior

### 3. Analyze
- [ ] Extract the buggy code snippet
- [ ] Identify root cause (not just symptom)
- [ ] Write corrected code
- [ ] Extract the key principle/lesson

### 3. Structure Document
- [ ] Frontmatter: tags array
- [ ] Header: # Problem [ID]: [Name]
- [ ] Section: Mistake (one-liner)
- [ ] Section: What Went Wrong (code + explanation)
- [ ] Section: Why (root cause, ~2-3 lines)
- [ ] Section: Fix (corrected code)
- [ ] Section: Key Lesson (takeaway principle)

### 4. Format Rules
- Use markdown code blocks with language tag
- Mark wrong code with ❌, right with ✅
- Tables for comparisons
- Bullets > prose
- Target length: ~150 words
- **Folder**: `mistakes/` directory
- **File**: `[ID]_[name].md` or `[topic].md`
- **Check existing**: Append to file if topic already documented

### 5. Checklist Before Save
- [ ] Check if `mistakes/[topic].md` exists (append, don't overwrite)
- [ ] Type auto-detected correctly (logic|implementation|edge-case|conceptual)
- [ ] Frontmatter includes relevant tags
- [ ] Code examples are complete & runnable
- [ ] Root cause explained (not just "forgot X")
- [ ] Key lesson is generalizable (not problem-specific)
- [ ] No fluff, no "overview" sections

## Example Flow

**Input:** "I forgot to return from recursive base case"

**Output:**
```markdown

  - recursion
  - logic

# Recursion: Missing Base Case Return

## Mistake
Function implicitly returns None instead of early exit.

## What Went Wrong
❌ No return statement in base case

## Why
When recursion doesn't explicitly return, Python returns None. This breaks logic chains.

## Fix
✅ Add return statement in base case

## Key Lesson
Base cases must return appropriate value OR structure must not depend on return value.
```

## Type Detection Guide

| Type | Indicators | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Logic** | Wrong condition, incorrect sequence, algorithm flow breaks | `if x > 5` when should be `if x < 5` |
| **Implementation** | Variable mismatch, wrong reference, state not updated | `node = stack.pop()` then using `current.right` |
| **Edge-case** | Boundary missed, null/empty not handled, off-by-one | `while i < len` should be `while i <= len` |
| **Conceptual** | Misunderstands data structure, algorithm behavior, property | Appending recursive return values instead of modifying shared list |

# Postorder Traversal: Missing Base Case & Stack Initialization

## Mistake
Base case check missing; stack1 initialized with root without null guard—adapted from preorder without proper modification.

## What Went Wrong

❌ **Original buggy code:**
\```python
class Solution:
    def postorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        results = []
        stack1 = [root]  # No null check before adding
        stack2 = []
        # ... rest of logic
\```

**Issues:**
1. No `if not root:` check → attempts to push None into stack1
2. Stack1 initialized with root unconditionally → breaks on None input

## Why
Copied preorder traversal pattern but removed the base case guard. Preorder/inorder/postorder all need early exit for empty trees—this isn't optional when using iterative two-stack approach.

## Fix

✅ **Corrected code:**
\```python
class Solution:
    def postorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:  # Base case guard
            return []

        results = []
        stack1 = [root]  # Safe to initialize now
        stack2 = []

        while stack1:
            node = stack1.pop()
            stack2.append(node)
            if node.left:
                stack1.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                stack1.append(node.right)

        while stack2:
            node = stack2.pop()
            results.append(node.val)
        return results
\```

## Key Lesson
**Boundary guards before collection initialization:** Always check for None/empty input before pushing into stacks or queues. Pattern adaptations (copying preorder→postorder) need full guard restoration, not partial refactoring.

_**Agent (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 2026-01-25T05:54:15.045Z)**_

Documented. Key takeaway: **boundary guards before collection init**—the base case `if not root: return []` must come before `stack1 = [root]` to prevent None being pushed onto the stack. This is especially critical when adapting between traversal patterns.

why did you  create a mistakes fodler in claude / skills? ---  i have a mistake folder in here. in current folder.

Oh, I made a mistake. The user is right - they have a mistakes folder in the current working directory (/home/abhishek/Downloads/experiments/learnings), not in the .claude/skills directory. I should have written the file to the existing mistakes folder in the current directory instead of creating it in .claude/skills/document-mistake/mistakes/.

The user is calling me out for not checking where the mistakes folder actually exists. I should have explored the project structure first or asked. Since they said "i have a mistake folder in here" - they mean in the current project directory.

I should acknowledge this mistake and move the file to the correct location.

    10→## Workflow
    11→
    12→### 1. Gather Info
    13→- [ ] Problem ID or topic name
    14→- [ ] Buggy code + explanation (extract from context)
    15→- [ ] ⚠️ DO NOT ask for type—auto-detect from code
    16→
    17→### 2. Auto-Detect Type
    18→Analyze the mistake and classify:
    19→- **Logic**: Algorithm flaw, wrong condition, incorrect sequence
    20→- **Implementation**: Variable mismatch, wrong reference, state management
    21→- **Edge-case**: Boundary condition, null handling, off-by-one
    22→- **Conceptual**: Misunderstanding of data structure/algorithm behavior
    23→
    24→### 3. Analyze
    25→- [ ] Extract the buggy code snippet
    26→- [ ] Identify root cause (not just symptom)
    27→- [ ] Write corrected code
    28→- [ ] Extract the key principle/lesson
    29→
    30→### 3. Structure Document
    31→- [ ] Frontmatter: tags array
    32→- [ ] Header: # Problem [ID]: [Name]
    33→- [ ] Section: Mistake (one-liner)
    34→- [ ] Section: What Went Wrong (code + explanation)
    35→- [ ] Section: Why (root cause, ~2-3 lines)
    36→- [ ] Section: Fix (corrected code)
    37→- [ ] Section: Key Lesson (takeaway principle)
    38→
    39→### 4. Format Rules
    40→- Use markdown code blocks with language tag
    41→- Mark wrong code with ❌, right with ✅
    42→- Tables for comparisons
    43→- Bullets > prose
    44→- Target length: ~150 words
    45→- **Folder**: `../mistakes/` (project root)
    46→- **File**: `[ID]_[name].md` or `[topic].md`
    47→- **Check existing**: Append to file if topic already documented
    48→
    49→### 5. Checklist Before Save
    50→- [ ] Check if `../mistakes/[topic].md` exists (append, don't overwrite)

ok, go ahead

The user says "ok, go ahead" - this seems to be in response to something that was interrupted. Let me check what was happening. Looking at the conversation, I just updated the skill file to correctly identify the mistakes folder location. The updates were:

1. Added a note at the top of the skill file
2. Updated the folder reference from `mistakes/` to `../mistakes/` 
3. Updated the checklist reference similarly
4. Removed the incorrectly created mistakes folder from the skill directory

The user's "ok, go ahead" seems to be giving me the green light to proceed, but I've already completed the task of updating the skill. The skill now correctly points to the project root `mistakes/` folder instead of the skill directory.

Let me verify everything is correct and provide a summary.

Done. Updated the skill to correctly point to your project root `mistakes/` folder:

- Added note at top: "Mistakes are stored in the project root `mistakes/` folder"
- Changed folder references from `mistakes/` to `../mistakes/` (lines 45 & 50)
- Removed the incorrectly created mistakes folder from the skill directory

Your `postorder_traversal_stack_initialization.md` is now in the correct location: `/home/abhishek/Downloads/experiments/learnings/mistakes/`

Future mistake documents will be saved there automatically.
