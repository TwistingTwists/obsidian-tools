Don't judge

- negative words to positive : 
	- Risky  --> bold , strange --> interesting, big step! 
- validate feelings with words

| **Scenario**                                                | **Judgmental Response (Avoid)**                                  | **Non-Judgmental Response (Practice)**                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A friend shares they’re switching careers late in life.** | _"Aren’t you too old to start over? That’s risky."_              | _"That’s a bold move. What inspired you to make this change?"_        |
| **Someone admits they’re struggling emotionally.**          | _"It’s not that big of a deal. You’ll get over it."_             | _"That sounds really tough. How are you feeling about it right now?"_ |
| **A coworker talks about an unconventional hobby.**         | _"Why would you spend your time on that? It seems strange."_     | _"That’s so interesting! What got you into that hobby?"_              |
| **A friend says they’re moving to another country.**        | _"Why would you want to leave everything behind? That’s crazy."_ | _"Wow, that’s a big step. What excites you most about moving?"_       |
| **A family member reveals they’ve made a mistake.**         | _"How could you let that happen? You should’ve known better."_   | _"We all make mistakes. What do you think you’ve learned from it?"_   |

By replacing judgmental responses with open-ended, curious, and empathetic ones, you create space for understanding and meaningful dialogue.
