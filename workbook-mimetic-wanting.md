**Tactics Applied:** 1, 3, 8
*Use this table to identify who is programming your desires. Be brutally honest.*

| The "Want" (What do I desire?)                                  | The "Why" (My logical excuse)                                                                | **The Model** (Who has/wants this?)            | Proximity (Close friend vs. Celebrity) | Emotional State (Inspired vs. Jealous) | Boundary Needed? (Yes/No)    |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |

### Table 2: The "Thick" vs. "Thin" Test (Filtration)
**Tactics Applied:** 6, 7, 9, 11
*Use this to test if a desire is truly yours ("Thick") or just a mimetic copy ("Thin").*

| The Desire | **The "Secret" Test** (Would I want this if I couldn't tell anyone?) | **Hierarchy Check** (Does this support my #1 value?) | **The Suffering Test** (Am I willing to suffer for the *process*, or just the result?) | Verdict: Thick or Thin? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., Buying a Tesla* | *Probably not* | *No (Value is Financial Freedom)* | *No, I hate car payments* | **Thin** |
| *e.g., Writing a book* | *Yes, I need to get ideas out* | *Yes (Value is Creativity)* | *Yes, I enjoy the struggle of writing* | **Thick** |

### Table 3: Mapping Systems & Flywheels (Environment)
**Tactics Applied:** 5, 8, 12, 13
*Analyze the systems you exist in. Are you in a "Positive Flywheel" (desire leads to fulfillment) or a "Negative Flywheel" (desire leads to anxiety)?*

| System/Environment (Work, Social Group, Twitter) | The Currency (What defines status here?) | The Opposites (Does this place allow nuance?) | Noise Level (Deep Silence vs. Constant Chatter) | The Flywheel Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., My Sales Team* | *Revenue & "Hustle"* | *No, you are either a winner or loser* | *Constant Chatter/Slack* | *Negative (Anxiety loop)* |
| *e.g., Hiking Group* | *Nature/Endurance* | *Yes, struggle & peace coexist* | *Deep Silence* | *Positive (Health loop)* |
| | | | | |

### Table 4: Intentional Imitation (Innovation)
**Tactics Applied:** 2, 4
*You cannot stop imitating, but you can choose your models. Use this to switch from imitating "Status" to imitating "Wisdom."*

| Current "Unhealthy" Model | What I was copying (Status/Possession) | **New "Wisdom" Model** (Can be historical/fictional) | **Trait to Mimulate** (Virtue/Character) | How to Imitate (Concrete Action) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Instagram Influencer* | *Lifestyle/Travel photos* | *Marcus Aurelius* | *Stoic resilience* | *Journaling every morning* |
| | | | | |

### Table 5: The Responsibility Mirror (Legacy)
**Tactics Applied:** 10, 15
*Recognize that you are a model for others. How are you shaping their desires?*

| Who is watching me? (Kids, Employees, Friends) | What desire am I currently modeling for them? | Is this desire "fulfillable" or "scarce"? | The "Anti-Mimetic" Story I can share |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., My Junior Devs* | *Overworking / Stress* | *Scarce (Only one person can be "top")* | *Share a story about a time I failed but learned* |
| | | | |

### Daily Log: The Speed of Truth
**Tactic Applied:** 11, 14
*A simple log to increase your reaction time to mimetic infection.*

| Date | Trigger Event (Saw a post, heard a comment) | Initial Reaction (Jealousy, Anger, Urge to buy) | **"Who is the Model?"** (Name them immediately) | Time to Truth (How long to admit it?) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Dec 22* | *Friend bought a house* | *Panic about my finances* | *My friend (Peer)* | *5 minutes* |
