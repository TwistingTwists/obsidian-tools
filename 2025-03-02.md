##### Deploy to prod - for payment testing
- [x] ensure axum proxy can be connected with nofeeebooking
	- [x] 8080 for axum proxy and then try to connect 
	- [x] read services section of fly.toml 
	- [x] read internal connections on community.fly.io
		- [x] make the axum proxy run on ipv4 and ipv6 both.

- [ ] optimise proxy response time
	- [x] find where time is spent 
		- [x] RUST_LOG debug 
	- [x] DNS caching via hickory-dns in reqwest

- perf comes from native code + using shared memory (not available in js) + all cores (not in js)
	- someone with 32 cores, will see 100x improvement. Why? - 3x comes from native code , 3x comes from concurrency. on 32 cores, concurrency is 32x. => 3 * 32 = 100x 
	- Why concurrency? - parsing 4700 files from String to AST => output AST in same (Shared) data strucutre. in JS, workers are isolated => pass the AST of worker to parent => overhead
- Rust - cyclic data structures is hard??
	- porting is hard. in rust, you have to rewrite. lol
