#### Writing Typescript compiler in Go
[Source](https://youtu.be/ZlGza4oIleY?t=1469)

- perf comes from native code + using shared memory (not available in js) + all cores (not in js)
	- someone with 32 cores, will see 100x improvement. Why? - 3x comes from native code , 3x comes from concurrency. on 32 cores, concurrency is 32x. => 3 * 32 = 100x 
	- Why concurrency? - parsing 4700 files from String to AST => output AST in same (Shared) data strucutre. in JS, workers are isolated => pass the AST of worker to parent => overhead
- Rust - cyclic data structures is hard??
	- porting is hard. in rust, you have to rewrite. lol
- compiler phases 
	- parse to AST -> TypeCheck
	- both steps are parallelised using go routines,
	- TypeCheck is tricky. Give a part of a file to one go routine, let it resolve types, then merge and deduplicate the outputs of other go routines. Four go routines may be resolving the same type. [But assumption is that most of the types are local to the file.](https://youtu.be/ZlGza4oIleY?t=2447)

Longest uncrossed knight's path


Certainly! Here's a markdown table listing LeetCode problems that involve spatial reasoning and direction constraints, similar to the example you provided:

Explanation of Similarity:

These problems require understanding and implementing spatial constraints and direction-based rules within a grid or matrix. Similar to the example you provided, they involve navigating through cells based on specific movement rules, ensuring that constraints are met, and often involve backtracking or depth-first search techniques to explore all possible paths or configurations.



Detecting cycles in graphs is a common theme in LeetCode's hard-level problems. Here are some problems that involve cycle detection and graph traversal:

1. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid: Given a 2D array of characters, determine if there exists any cycle consisting of the same value in the grid. 


2. Longest Cycle in a Graph: Find the length of the longest cycle in a directed graph. If no cycle exists, return -1. 


3. Shortest Cycle in a Graph: Determine the length of the shortest cycle in an undirected graph. If no cycle exists, return -1. 


4. Redundant Connection: Given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes, an edge is added, forming a cycle. Identify the edge that, when removed, will leave the graph as a tree without cycles. 


5. Course Schedule: Determine if it's possible to finish all courses given their prerequisites, which can be represented as a directed graph. Detecting cycles is crucial in this problem.



These problems require a deep understanding of graph traversal techniques, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), to detect cycles and analyze graph structures effectively.
