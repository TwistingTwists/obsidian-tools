Outreach messages :
1. Hi name, creative workflows easier esp for designer. I would love to understand 15 min to understand your pain points. No pitch. Just real pain points. 
	1. Free coffee  is on me if you are spot on. 
2. Hey, I am building workflow for the X use case


Founder story:
1. I am building X . Talked to 10 creators -- realised Y pain point -- building for that. 
2. Video editor for agents , just by typing what they want, spending hours on edits they do not want -- 
3. This is ai infrastructure for video editing -- where tooling does the heavy call, not the talent 

Focus on message not mechanics. 

Hook :
- building let's you describe in plain language and it gets it. 


Selling skilling:
- record your self pitching 60 sec story. 
- what is one thing that will make you use 
- prove that you have solved the problem for others. 

Clearly explain the problem, sound confident, conviction?? 
Make someone feel urgency -- show in voice and ask 

Clear ask at the end of pitch
- feedback on prototype by Friday 
- someone in your network might  - 2 people 
- short demo next week to show how ot works ? 
- 15 min chat to refine the problem? 

Quick note and low pressure -- when asking referral 
- refer suggested that I reach out. Would love to learn someone from your network who is working in the domain. 


Help me refine pitch, and have clear ask.

Data moat: 
Uniqueness -- what is the data  
Scale - how much 
Exclusivity  - access - only you have the data

Warehouse robots:

Logistic companies 
Data moat 
Inventory or picking , reducing mispicks via computer vision

Retina robotics - one pilot
Real paint point ?

Sit in a warehouse - what takes you most time. Wasted time, observe. 

Owners - cost, speed, risk 
Sell the owner the outcome.
