Why create personal brand? 
* Show the values you stand for. Helps people resonate wtih you easily. Discover your values - of public life. 


Here are some of my beliefs that are connected with the engineering industry:

Software Development is a team sport.
Great teams build great software.
Progress over perfection.
Engineering is more about people than tech.
I rather measure team productivity than developer productivity.
I don’t measure developer productivity by lines of code delivered,
amount of PRs finished or story points delivered.
LeetCode type challenges are not the best way to assess the fit of
candidates in the technical interview.

Helping others is much more important than individual contribution.
A big list of technologies listed in the CV is not as important as you may
think.
