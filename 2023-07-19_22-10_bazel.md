## Bazel - use it or not use it!

[Link](https://earthly.dev/blog/bazel-build/)
Bazel’s not so great at publishing reusable libraries for others. You can publish deployable artifacts fairly easily, but it’s not great right now, maybe won’t ever be great, at publishing reusable libraries.

When would I definitely use it?

I would definitely, unfortunately, use it when I had a million lines of code or more. If you have multiple languages that you have dependencies between – like in our [Netflix] case, we’re doing a lot of machine learning, but we do data processing in Scala, but we then package up some apps that have like Python for model scoring or model training – so there are dependencies because these systems pass data between one another, maybe then you want to consider Bazel. Each of these would be like maybe-Bazel? And if you accumulate enough of them, you give Bazel a try. I think once you get over like 5 million lines of code, I really wouldn’t do anything other than Bazel. It’s almost the only game in town.
