[[Brene Brown - Living Into Values]]

## aligning-action-to-values
- **The "Simple but Hard" Exercise:** **The 90% Rule.**
    - **The Task:** Look at a decision, opportunity, or commitment in front of you. Rate it from 0 to 100 based on how much it aligns with what you care about.
    - **The Hard Part:** If it is anything less than a 90, **change it to a 0**.
    - **Why it works:** It forces you to realize that "good" opportunities are the enemy of "great" ones. It prevents you from cluttering your life with things that are just "okay" and leaves room for the few things that truly align with your soul.
