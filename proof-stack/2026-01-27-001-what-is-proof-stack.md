### What needs to be a ‘ready’ and prepared thing?

- [x]  a list of sales template /  achievements / etc
- set of videos to showcase the deep technical expertise
- high quality blogs that are referred by the people - kind of very expert level blogs - 1,2 on the topics we care.

## Principles for sales conversations

| if X happens | respond with  | example. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| if client asks for X (proof) | give X, fast

offer the obvious next ‘proof’ from your proof stack  | Lead emails: "Can you do X?”

You reply (in 5 mins): "Yes. Here is a 3-minute video of us doing exactly X last week. [Link]. Do you want to see the code?” |
| if you offer - Give a Grand Slam offer. | [see this on how-to](https://www.notion.so/2026-sales-vault-checklist-2e1401c8c27580afa4abd26df17f17e2?pvs=21) |  |

## What kind of sales assets we need?

HIGH LEVEL IDEA: the ones that help stack ‘**Proof of competence**’. 

1. UGLY walk through = technical proof - showcasing the ide / terminal / log walkthroughs / etc. UGLY but authentic 
2. Torture Proof = error cases, edge cases highlighting (george asked this) 
    - **Record "The Vault":**
        - Video A: 2 mins - High-level user flow.
        - Video B: 3 mins - Deep dive into the logs/terminal showing "Thinking" process.
        - Video C: 2 mins - Edge cases (trying to break it) =  Record a video specifically designed to **break** your AI.
3. Volume of Proof 
    - **Social Proof:** Screenshots of Slack messages from happy clients (blur names if needed) saying "Wow, this saved us 10 hours."
    - **Data Proof:** A simple graph. "Client X processed 5,000 files in 2 minutes."

## How to give offers?

**Current Offer:**

"We will build your AI agents. Trust us, we are good."

**Hormozi-Style Grand Slam Offer:**

"We will build your Multi-Step AI Agent Prototype in 14 days. We will provide a video log of the logic daily. If it doesn't handle the edge cases you specified in the scope, **you don't pay the final invoice.**"

**Why this works:**

1. **Dream Outcome:** They get the agent.
2. **Likelihood of Achievement:** High (because you are willing to bet your own money/time on it).
3. **Time Delay:** 14 days (Specific).
4. **Effort/Sacrifice:** Low (If it fails, they keep their money).

# Alex Hormozi's Value Equation

Hormozi preaches one core formula to create irresistible offers.

$$
Value = \frac{\text{Dream Outcome} \times \text{Perceived Likelihood of Achievement}}{\text{Time Delay} \times \text{(Effort + Sacrifice)}}
$$

## The Goal

To increase the value of your offer, you must:

1. **Maximize the Top** (Outcome + Certainty)
2. **Minimize the Bottom** (Time + Effort)

### The Variables Breakdown

### ⬆️ Increase These (The Numerator)

- **Dream Outcome:** What the prospect wants to achieve (the destination).
- **Perceived Likelihood of Achievement:** How real the prospect thinks the result is and how likely they believe *they* can achieve it with your help.

### ⬇️ Decrease These (The Denominator)

- **Time Delay:** The time between buying and receiving the benefit. (Faster results = Higher value).
- **Effort & Sacrifice:** The physical/mental difficulty and costs required to achieve the result. (Easy/Done-for-you = Higher value).
