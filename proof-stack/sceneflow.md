For video capabilties (notch + sceneflow)  - we need to create three types of proof 

1. end to end scenario of one use case -> like cinematic / ugc for video generation + sceneflow for video editing capabilities
2. logs for show casing technical details / code 
3. evals (google sheet? or some other way)
