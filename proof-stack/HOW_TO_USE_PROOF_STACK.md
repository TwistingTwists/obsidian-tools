## Medium 1: Email Sales Outreach

### Formula: The 5-Minute Response

**Prospect Message:**
> "Can you build an AI agent that can navigate our customer support portal and extract data?"

**Your Response (under 5 min):**

```
Subject: Yes—here's proof [PROSPECT_NAME]

Hi [PROSPECT_NAME],

Exactly what you need. We built Strot—an AI agent framework that scrapes complex web interfaces 7x faster than alternatives.

Here's a 3-minute video of it handling a real support portal:
