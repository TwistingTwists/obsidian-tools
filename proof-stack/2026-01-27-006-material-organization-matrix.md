## TL;DR SECTIONS (Summary Before Each Major Asset)

### Pattern for Every Document:

**[Document Title]**

**TL;DR (one sentence):**
[Concise summary of what reader will learn]

---

### Example Implementation:

#### Document: "Technical Deep-Dive: Building Production-Grade Multi-Agent Systems"

**TL;DR:**
*Our agents plan → execute → validate → recover, handling 95% of edge cases before you hit them in production.*

---

#### Document: "Build vs. Buy vs. Partner: The Real Economics"

**TL;DR:**
*Build takes 6 months ($250K), Buy takes 1 month ($30-50K), Partner takes 14 days ($X)—we recommend Partner if you need speed + reliability.*

---

#### Document: "How We Handle Edge Cases (Error Analysis)"

**TL;DR:**
*We've encountered 50+ failure modes. Here's our taxonomy, how we detect each, and the recovery strategy we use.*
