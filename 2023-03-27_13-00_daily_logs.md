1. api, backend engineering, api response time, profiling, remote code injection
2. task assign to people.
3. usefulness is inversely proportional to popularity
4. accessible to programmers - elixir beginners, elixir moderate, elixir advanced log analyse krta hu.
5. why is FP useful there? -- not python not js.
6. philosophical level and surface level stuff.
7. libraries specific and code in that language. - kaha execute ho raha hai --- give things with lesser context.
8. Adoption of future. -- keep conversations basic - Explain like I am 5.
9. JS vs Elixir -- successful things keep at surface level.
10. deal feasible - engineers loose touch why they build it. Bring them context of the deal or important task
11. JS vs elixir
