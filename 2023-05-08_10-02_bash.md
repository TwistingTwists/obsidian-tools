### sed

```bash
sed '/^\s*[a-zA-Z].*:\s.*/p;d'
```

 This command filters the lines that match a specific pattern. The pattern looks for lines that start with zero or more spaces, followed by one or more alphabetic characters, followed by a colon and a space. The p;d at the end of the command tells sed to print the matching lines and delete all others.
