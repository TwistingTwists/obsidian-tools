## other ideas 

- The essence is the first order impact of the a concept / method / scaffold
	- that is why having your own model which has these essence distilled. so that you can let go of scaffolding with time. the better the essence distilling , the lesser the time needed 
- hence , making scaffolds is important. to understand the boundaries. but boundaries of a road is not where should drive. the boundaries help see the road better. but the driving has to be still in the middle of the road. that is the essence of driving. 



[[navigating ambiguity]]

## Focus Goal 

- [ ] MIT 682 - distributed systems playlist and papers reading
- [ ] hang around in turso discord?


## Possibly for next weeks 
- tantivy internals
- rust for rustaceans book - connection pools
- MIT 682
