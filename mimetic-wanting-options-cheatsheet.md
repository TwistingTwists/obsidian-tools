*A reference guide for completing the Self-Awareness Tables.*

---

## 1. For Table 1: The Model Audit
*Goal: accurately identify who is influencing you and the nature of that influence.*

### Column: The "Why" (The Rationalization)
*We rarely admit we are copying others. We usually invent a logical reason. Which one is yours?*
*   **The Pragmatist:** "It’s the smartest financial move."
*   **The Altruist:** "I’m doing it for my family/kids."
*   **The Fatalist:** "I have no choice; this is just what you do in my industry."
*   **The Optimizer:** "I need to maximize my potential/productivity."
*   **The Hedonist:** "I just really like the taste/feel/aesthetic." (Often a lie for status goods).
*   **The Justice Warrior:** "I need to prove them wrong."

### Column: Proximity (The Danger Level)
*   **Internal Model (Danger: High):** People you can interact with. There is a possibility of rivalry.
    *   *Examples:* Coworker, Sibling, Best Friend, Ex-Partner, The "Successful" Cousin, The Peer on LinkedIn.
*   **External Model (Danger: Low):** People outside your social sphere. No possibility of rivalry.
    *   *Examples:* Billionaires (Musk/Bezos), Movie Stars, Historical Figures, Fictional Characters.
*   **The "Freshmanstan" Model:** People just slightly ahead of you (e.g., a Senior Associate if you are a Junior). *Most dangerous category.*

### Column: Emotional State
*   **Worship:** "They are perfect; I am nothing."
*   **Envy:** "They have what I deserve."
*   **Schadenfreude:** "I secretly hope they fail."
*   **Anxiety:** "If I don't keep up with them, I become irrelevant."
*   **Indifference:** "I see what they have, but I feel no pull." (The Goal State).

### Column: Boundary Strategy
*   **The Digital Mute:** Unfollow/Mute stories (Out of sight, out of mind).
*   **The Topic Ban:** "I will no longer discuss work/crypto/politics with this person."
*   **The Physical Buffer:** Sit further away; decline the invite to the specific event where they shine.
*   **The "Gray Rock":** Become boring to them so they stop competing with you.

## 2. For Table 2: Thick vs. Thin Desires
*Goal: Separate biological/biographical truths from social contagions.*

### Column: Hierarchy of Values (The Standard)

*   **The "Resume-Fail":** If I couldn't add this to my LinkedIn, I wouldn't do it.
*   **The "Dark Room" Pass:** I would do this alone in a room even if nobody ever saw the result.

### Column: The Suffering Test
*   **Process Suffering (Thick):** You enjoy the headache of solving the problem (e.g., debugging code, editing drafts, sore muscles).
*   **Status Suffering (Thin):** You only tolerate the suffering because you want the reward (e.g., starving yourself to look thin, working a job you hate just for the title).
