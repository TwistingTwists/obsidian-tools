## What is memory -  for Agents? 

1) Facts: atomic pieces of information independent of the state of the agent or environment (e.g., a user’s name, preferences, organizational charts). Facts can change over time, but at any given moment they are generally context-independent. 
2) Procedures: established conventions for doing things (e.g., "how to troubleshoot a failed login" or "how to guide a customer through a sales process to the most fitting product"). Procedures can be viewed as a sequence of state-dependent requirements or preferences over actions.

## Classification
- based on access patterns - short term and long term 
	- in reflexion paper - short term (trajectory of the agentic calls) + long term (Evalautor's high level idea - called EXPERIENCE)
	- EXPERIENCE = self-reflection to distill long, failed trajectories into relevant experiences that can are used as "self-hints" in the future. = compaction of the short term memory (trajectory) into experience
	- 
- based on granularity of information - hierarchical memory 



### A-Mem paper notes:

These systems require agent developers to predefine memory storage structures, specify storage points within the workflow, and establish retrieval timing.
- dynamic memory structuring without relying on static, predetermined memory operations.
