[Source : ](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/ideas)

A novel idea is one that's not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and _worthwhile_. I've identified five categories:

- **Counter-intuitive** — "Oh, I never realized the world worked that way."
- **Counter-narrative** — "Wow, that's not how I was told the world worked!"
- **Shock and awe** — "That's crazy. I would have never believed it."
- **Elegant articulations** — "Beautiful. I couldn't have said it better myself."
- **Make someone feel seen** — "Yes! That's exactly how I feel!"

Ideas resonate when they're wrapped in:

- Stories
- Analogies
- Examples
- Authentic voice

In other words:

> Writing Quality = Novelty x Resonance


 Step one is choosing an **objective** for your post, such as:  

1. Open people’s eyes by proving the status quo wrong. [Example](https://www.julian.com/blog/vanity-metrics).
2. Share a solution to a tough problem. [Example](https://www.julian.com/blog/life-planning).
3. Distill an overwhelming topic into something approachable. [Example](https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples).
4. Tell a suspenseful and emotional story that imparts a lesson. [Example](https://www.julian.com/blog/storytelling).
5. Articulate something everyone’s thinking about but no one is saying. Cut through the noise.
6. Identify key trends on a topic. Then use them to predict the future.
7. Contribute original insights to a field through your research and experimentation.  
    

Step two is pairing that objective with what **motivates** you:  

1. Does writing this article get something off your chest?
2. Does it help reason through a nagging, unsolved problem you have?
3. Does it persuade others to do something you believe is important?
4. Do you obsess over the topic and want others to geek out over it too?


A hook is a _half_-told story. You raise a question then tease only part of the answer:  

- **Questions** — Pose an intriguing question, but don’t give the full answer.
- **Narratives** — Share the start of a narrative, but withhold the conclusion.
- **Research** — Highlight research findings, but only a small portion.
- **Arguments** — Make an unexpected claim, but don't explain how it's true.
