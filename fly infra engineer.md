### Basics

- incident is a series of issues => timeline

### What does the support engineer need?

- list of issues - by severity 
	- secondary effects of those issues / if any
	- residual issues that may arise 
- impact - 
	- category = technical  / business  / user 
	- 
- scope of issues - api / app / region / users with certain criteria
- Action
	- mitigation = Are there workarounds? Should they restart a service?
	- links to resources - runbook / past incident reports / monitoring dashboards
	- 

Tip: 

Quantify: **numbers**, **timeframes**, and **percentages**



Hygiene: 
- Scannable message
