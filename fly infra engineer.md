### Basics

- incident is a series of issues => timeline

### What do support engineers do?

- Route customer complaints 
	- (e.g., “Payment delays? Check Redis cache metrics”).
- Troubleshoot technical issues by analyzing logs and metrics.
- Document solutions and update the knowledge base.
- Escalate complex problems to engineering teams.
- Monitor system performance to prevent issues.
- Provide training and support documentation to customers.

### What does the support engineer need?

- Discovery - 
	- HOW = What alerts have been triggered in our monitoring systems?
	- Timeline  - first issue
- list of issues - by severity 
	- secondary effects of those issues / if any

- impact - 
	- category = technical  / business  / user 
- scope of issues - api / app / region / users with certain criteria
- Action
	- mitigation = Are there workarounds? Should they restart a service?
	- links to resources - runbook / past incident reports / monitoring dashboards
 
Tip: 

Quantify: **numbers**, **timeframes**, and **percentages**

- Scannable message
