Based on the screenshots provided from Luke Burgis’s book *Wanting*, the core philosophy is **Mimetic Desire**. This is the idea (originally from René Girard) that we don't desire things spontaneously; we desire what *other people* desire. We imitate "models."

To increase your self-awareness using these 15 tactics, you have to accept a difficult premise: **most of your goals, wants, and anxieties are not yours—they are copied from someone else.**

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use the specific tactics listed in your screenshot to radically increase self-awareness:

### Phase 1: The Audit (Diagnosis)
*Goal: Identify who is currently programming your brain.*

**Use Tactic 1: Name your models**
*   **The Self-Awareness Exercise:** Grab a piece of paper. Write down the 3-5 things you want most right now (a promotion, a specific car, to be "fit," a vacation to Italy).
*   **The Hard Question:** Next to each want, ask: *"Who do I know that also wants this, or already has this?"*
*   **The Insight:** If you are chasing a specific career path, is it because you love the work, or because a "Model" (a rival, a mentor, a parent, a peer) values it? Naming the person breaks the spell.

**Use Tactic 8: Map out the systems of desire in your world**
*   **The Self-Awareness Exercise:** Look at your workplace or social circle.
*   **The Hard Question:** *"Who is competing with whom?"* and *"What is the currency of status here?"*
*   **The Insight:** Realizing that you are stressed not because you are failing, but because you are caught in a "mimetic rivalry" (competing for the same limited resource/status) allows you to step back and observe yourself objectively.

### Phase 2: The Filter (Differentiation)
*Goal: Distinguish between "Thin" desires (mimetic, fleeting) and "Thick" desires (authentic, enduring).*

**Use Tactic 6: Establish a hierarchy of values**
*   **The Self-Awareness Exercise:** Most people have values, but few have a *hierarchy*.
*   **The Hard Question:** If you had to choose between "Recognition" and "Freedom," which wins? If you don't decide, the crowd decides for you.
*   **The Insight:** When you feel torn or anxious, it is usually because a Mimetic Model is pressuring you to violate your own hierarchy. Knowing your hierarchy creates an immune system against other people's wants.

**Use Tactic 9: Put desires to the test**
*   **The Self-Awareness Exercise:** When you feel a strong pull toward something new.
*   **The Hard Question:** Imagine you get the thing you want, but **no one can ever know about it.** You cannot post it on Instagram, tell your parents, or show your colleagues. Do you still want it?
*   **The Insight:** If the desire vanishes when the audience vanishes, it is purely mimetic.

**Use Tactic 12 & 14: Invest in deep silence / Practice meditative thought**
*   **The Self-Awareness Exercise:** Spend 15 minutes alone without a phone.
*   **The Insight:** Mimesis requires noise and signal. It requires checking social media to see what is "cool" or "correct." Silence cuts the cord to the Models. In silence, the desires that remain are usually the "Thick" ones.

### Phase 3: The Detox (Action)
*Goal: Curate your influences consciously.*

**Use Tactic 3: Create boundaries with unhealthy models**
*   **The Self-Awareness Exercise:** Identify people who make you feel inadequate, jealous, or hyper-competitive.
*   **The Insight:** These people are your "Internal Mediators" (models who are close enough to be rivals). Self-awareness is recognizing that you cannot simply "will" yourself not to compete with them; you must physically or digitally distance yourself to regain your own mind.

**Use Tactic 4: Use imitation to drive innovation**
*   **The Self-Awareness Exercise:** Admit that you *must* imitate someone. Humans are learning machines.
*   **The Action:** Consciously choose a model who possesses a character trait you want (e.g., patience, integrity) rather than a status marker you want (e.g., fame, money).

### Phase 4: Responsibility (The Mirror)
*Goal: Recognize your power over others.*

**Use Tactic 15: Live as if you have a responsibility for what other people want**
*   **The Self-Awareness Exercise:** Observe how your actions affect your friends or team.
*   **The Hard Question:** *"Am I inducing anxiety in others by showing off?"* or *"Am I modeling a calm, purposeful life?"*
*   **The Insight:** This is the highest level of self-awareness. Realizing that you are a Model for others forces you to check your own behaviors, because you see the ripple effect of your own desires.

### Summary Checklist
To start today, look at the list and pick **Tactic 11: Increase the speed of truth.**

When you feel a pang of jealousy or a sudden urge to buy something, stop immediately and ask: **"Who am I imitating right now?"** The speed at which you can answer that question is the measure of your self-awareness.
