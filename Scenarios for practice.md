Do I do my best to maintain their honour during difficult conversations? Do I offer ways out, rather than corners?*                                                                                                |

Do I push them towards higher aspirations, without creating negative pressure? Do I use their positive traits to help achieve the overall vision?*                                                                     |
| **Encourage, Faults are Easy to Correct**    | Do I express confidence in the team’s ability to overcome challenges and emphasize that mistakes are part of the learning process?            | *Do I frame setbacks as learning opportunities rather than failures?

| **Understanding & Empathy**              | How often do I actively seek to understand individual team members' perspectives, motivations, and challenges (both work and personal, within appropriate boundaries)? | * **Actionable Insight:**  Do I have regular 1-on-1s focused on growth and challenges, not just project updates? How do I handle differing opinions?  How do I validate their feelings?  *  **Application:** Try active listening during 1-on-1s, asking open-ended questions like, "What's been the most challenging part of your work recently?" or "How can I better support you?"                                                             |
| **Genuine Appreciation & Recognition**   | How consistently and sincerely do I recognize and appreciate both individual and collective team contributions, highlighting specific skills and impact?               | * **Actionable Insight:**  Do I provide specific and timely feedback? Do I celebrate small wins, not just milestones?  Do I understand what type of recognition motivates each team member (public vs. private, verbal vs. tangible)?*  **Application:**  Implement a regular "shout-out" system and vary recognition styles based on individual preferences.                                                                                     |
| **Motivation & Alignment**               | How well do I align team goals with individual team members' aspirations, ensuring that tasks feel purposeful and relevant to their growth?                            | * **Actionable Insight:** Do I understand each team member’s career goals? How do I present tasks so that they resonate with their individual objectives?  Do I actively seek to connect their work with a larger purpose?*  **Application:** Discuss career aspirations with each team member and look for opportunities to assign tasks that fit their growth goals.                                                                            |
| **Active Listening & Communication**     | How effectively do I listen, facilitate, and encourage open communication during team discussions, ensuring everyone feels heard and valued?                           | * **Actionable Insight:** Do I interrupt or wait to respond? How do I make others feel safe to share?  Do I paraphrase and summarize to ensure understanding? How do I manage disagreements without shutting down conversation? * **Application:**  Implement a "round-robin" speaking method for team discussions to ensure everyone contributes and reflect back with "I think I hear you saying..." to check for correct understanding.        |
| **Positive & Inclusive Environment**     | How do I foster a positive and inclusive work environment that encourages collaboration, innovation, and a sense of belonging for all team members?                    | * **Actionable Insight:**  Do I model positive language and behavior? Do I celebrate team success, not just individual achievements?  Do I take steps to address biases? How do I promote mutual respect between team members?  * **Application:** Encourage peer-to-peer recognition and create a feedback mechanism to address any issues or concerns immediately.                                                                              |
| **Growth & Empowerment**                 | How do I empower team members to take ownership, make decisions, and learn from mistakes, while still providing support and guidance?                                  | * **Actionable Insight:** Do I provide autonomy while also offering resources? Do I frame mistakes as learning opportunities?  Do I encourage them to try new things?  Do I give them challenging opportunities? *  **Application:**  Delegate tasks with clear expectations and autonomy, then hold retrospectives after failures and successes to identify key learning.                                                                        |
| **Constructive Feedback & Development**  | How effectively do I provide feedback that is timely, specific, and focused on growth, while also avoiding public criticism or shaming?                                | * **Actionable Insight:** Do I deliver feedback immediately and in private?  Do I focus on actions and behavior instead of making it personal?  Do I praise before correcting? Do I help them understand the impact of their actions and behaviours?*  **Application:** Use the "feedback sandwich" method and always focus on the positive impacts, the specific behaviours that need to be changed and why, and finally encourage their growth. |
| **Humility & Vulnerability**             | How readily do I acknowledge my own mistakes and share my own learning experiences with the team to foster a culture of openness?                                      | * **Actionable Insight:** Do I take responsibility for errors? Do I model vulnerability and learning from mistakes? Do I create a safe space for them to admit their errors too? * **Application:** Share a mistake from your own work regularly during team meetings, and what you learned from it.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Influence & Collaboration**            | How do I frame new concepts, technologies, or approaches in a way that excites the team and encourages adoption and collaboration?                                     | * **Actionable Insight:** Do I focus on the benefit to the team or just the organization? Do I highlight the value and impact they can generate? How do I engage them in conversations before implementation?*  **Application:** When introducing change, use storytelling and analogies, focus on the problem being solved, and emphasize the positive impacts on their daily workflow.                                                          |
| **Inspiring Purpose & Vision**           | How do I connect the team's work to a larger purpose and inspire a shared vision that motivates them to excel?                                                         | * **Actionable Insight:**  Do I communicate the "why" behind projects? Do I connect the work to the organization's broader purpose?  Do I share the team's impact and successes to keep them focused? * **Application:** Hold a vision-setting session with the team, and revisit it regularly to keep everyone focused and aligned.                                                                                                              |
