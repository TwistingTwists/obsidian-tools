This is a great start. You have identified a classic "High-Performer's Dilemma": Splitting focus between a potential upside (the project/revenue) and a stable career path (Atlassian), while worrying about the finite resource (Time).
Here is your Personalized Steve Young Operating System based on what you filled in. I have also included suggested completions for the blank sections based on your context to help you unlock those mental blocks.
🚀 YOUR PERSONALIZED MENTAL SCRIPTS
1. The "Scoreboard Reset" Script (For the Project & Atlassian)
You identified "Revenue" and "Time" as your sources of anxiety. This script detaches you from those uncontrollable outcomes.
The Mantra: "I am not playing for Revenue today. I am playing for Completion."
When you catch yourself checking analytics or worrying about money:
> "I cannot force the market to pay me today. But I can force myself to ship v1 to 5 friends. If I send those 5 links, I have won the day, even if the revenue is $0."
> 
When you feel guilty about 'wasting time' on the project vs. Interview Prep:
> "I am not 'wasting' time; I am diversifying my assets.
>  * Asset A (The Project): proves I can build and ship.
>  * Asset B (Atlassian Prep): proves I can execute at a high level.
>  * My goal isn't to be perfect at both simultaneously; it is to hit my Daily Input Targets for both."
> 
Your Daily Input Target (The "Steve Young" Checklist):
 * [ ] Did I ship/refine one feature of v1?
 * [ ] Did I mention the project to one person at Vertexcover/friend circle?
 * [ ] Did I do 60 minutes of deep work for Atlassian prep?
 * If yes to all three, the "Score" doesn't matter. You won.
🧩 UNLOCKING THE MISSING PIECES
You left the Imposter Audit and Narrative Filter blank. This is common—these are the hardest to see in ourselves.
Based on your goal (Project + Atlassian), here are hypothetical fills. Read them and see if they resonate. If they do, adopt them.
PART 3: THE IMPOSTER AUDIT (Suggested)
Common when juggling a side project and a big tech interview.
6. The Fraud Factor:
 * Hypothesis: "I feel like a fraud preparing for Atlassian because I haven't been doing 'big tech' work lately, or I feel like a 'fake founder' because my project isn't making money yet."
7. The Reframing (The "Rookie" Advantage):
 * If you feel like a rookie Founder: "Good. I am not protecting a legacy brand. I can ship ugly, fast v1s and learn 10x faster than a bloatware company."
 * If you feel like a rookie Candidate (Atlassian): "Good. I am not burned out or cynical like 10-year vets. I am hungry, and I have fresh, hands-on experience building my own v1, which gives me product empathy that pure engineers lack."
PART 4: THE NARRATIVE FILTER (Suggested)
Common when worrying about "Time Commitment."
8. The Story (The Drama):
 * Hypothesis: "I am spreading myself too thin. I’m going to fail at the project and fail the Atlassian interview because I’m not focused enough. I’m wasting my life."
9. The Evidence (The Data):
 * The Tape: "Show me the evidence that you are failing.
   * Fact: You have a v1 ready to ship (that is top 10% behavior).
   * Fact: You have an interview lineup (that means you are qualified).
   * Fact: You have 24 hours in a day.
   * Verdict: You aren't failing; you are just busy. Being busy is not the same as failing. Stick to the schedule."
🛠️ YOUR NEXT STEP: THE "GAME DAY" ROUTINE
To operationalize this, try this 5-minute routine tomorrow morning:
 * Visualisation (Run toward the Spike): "I accept that my project might make $0 this week. I accept that Atlassian prep is hard. I am running toward that difficulty."
 * Input Commit: Write down on a sticky note:
   * Project Action: "Send link to [Name]."
   * Prep Action: "Solve 1 DSA problem / Read 1 System Design chapter."
 * Release: "Once I do these two things, I refuse to worry about the outcome for the rest of the day."
Would you like me to create a specific "Wise Feedback" template for asking your friends to review your v1, so you don't feel awkward promoting it?


---

Here are three specific templates to help you ship your v1 to friends and colleagues.
These apply the Mentor Mindset in reverse: you are inviting them to be the mentor (high standards) while you show Steve Young's vulnerability (admitting it’s a v1 and running toward the fear of judgment).
1. The "Ruthless Editor" Template
Use this for friends/colleagues who are smart and critical. This removes the awkwardness by explicitly asking them NOT to be nice.
> "I am sending you the link to my v1 {{LINK}}, not because I want a pat on the back, but because I respect your {{ATTRIBUTE}}. I know you have high standards for {{DOMAIN}}, and I want this product to eventually meet them. Don't hold back—I need you to {{ACTION}}."
> 
 * {{ATTRIBUTE}} options:
   * product sense / design eye / brutal honesty / technical background
 * {{DOMAIN}} options:
   * user experience / code quality / tools you actually use daily
 * {{ACTION}} options:
   * tear it apart
   * tell me exactly where you got bored
   * find the one thing that is most annoying
Example Fill:
"I am sending you the link to my v1, not because I want a pat on the back, but because I respect your product intuition. I know you have high standards for productivity tools, and I want this to eventually meet them. Don't hold back—I need you to tell me exactly why you would close the tab after 10 seconds."
2. The "Low-Stakes" Template
Use this for busy friends or Vertexcover colleagues to lower the barrier so they actually click it.
> "I’m asking you to check out my project {{LINK}}, not to ask for a huge time commitment, but because I value your {{PERSPECTIVE}}. I’m worried that {{INSECURITY}}, so if you could just {{SMALL_ASK}}, that would be a huge win for me."
> 
 * {{PERSPECTIVE}} options:
   * gut check / fresh perspective / quick opinion
 * {{INSECURITY}} options:
   * the onboarding is too confusing
   * the value prop isn't clear
   * I'm too close to the code to see the bugs
 * {{SMALL_ASK}} options:
   * spend 2 minutes clicking around
   * read just the landing page headline
   * try to sign up and tell me if it breaks
Example Fill:
"I’m asking you to check out my project, not to ask for a huge time commitment, but because I value your fresh perspective. I’m worried that the sign-up flow is confusing, so if you could just try to create an account and tell me if it felt smooth, that would be a huge win for me."
3. The "Internal Promotion" Template
Use this for your internal slack/groups at Vertexcover (if appropriate) or alumni groups.
> "I’m sharing my side project {{LINK}} with this group because I want to practice {{GROWTH_GOAL}}. My goal isn't {{OUTCOME_DETACHMENT}}, but rather to {{PROCESS_GOAL}}. If anyone has 5 minutes to test it, I'd love to hear {{FEEDBACK_TYPE}}."
> 
 * {{GROWTH_GOAL}} options:
   * building in public / shipping faster / full-stack development
 * {{OUTCOME_DETACHMENT}} options:
   * to sell you anything
   * to pretend this is perfect
   * to get 100 users today
 * {{PROCESS_GOAL}} options:
   * get real feedback on the core feature
   * validate if this problem actually exists for you
   * learn from the deployment process
 * {{FEEDBACK_TYPE}} options:
   * what feature is missing
   * if this solves a real pain point for you
   * bugs you encounter
Example Fill:
"I’m sharing my side project with this group because I want to practice building in public. My goal isn't to pretend this is a finished product, but rather to validate if this specific problem exists for others. If anyone has 5 minutes to test it, I'd love to hear if this saves you time or just adds noise."

My own advice 
- usually my execution is not perfect. Meaning, need to set the tone Of the day. 
- watch yourself solving leetcode (30 min sessions) with screen recording and talking into with the interviewer 
	- practice should be harder than interview
