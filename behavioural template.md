## Google’s Manager Responsibilities

Google’s Manager Responsibilities clarify three key expectations for every people manager at Google: Deliver Results, Develop People, Build Community.

These pillars provide a common language to define the manager role and integrate best practices into our people processes. When used effectively, they enable team success across all levels of the organization, from those managing small teams to senior leaders overseeing large organizations.


**Deliver Results** centers on creating tangible impact for the team and organization through determining priorities, setting and communicating goals, and leading the team to remain agile and motivated in times of change.

**Develop People** involves setting clear expectations, providing relevant feedback and coaching, engaging in meaningful career conversations, and supporting growth by exploring development opportunities with team members.

**Build Community** enables team success through collaboration, team norms and sustainable high performance, creating a resilient team capable of navigating changes and driving innovation together.
