### What is some asks for a proposal ? 


First step in sales 

1. Understand three things 
	- What is the requirement / problem  they are facing ?
	- What is the urgency?
	- What resources can they allocate to solve the problem?
- ex. - if someone asks for a proposal - don't send it right away, instead try to do 1. 



### What if : 

##### Client says - I can get it done for cheaper.

Responses
1. No Problem. What quote did they give you, so I understand?
2. If the investment was the same, who would you choose? 
	>focus shift from cost to VALUE in conversation
- FOLLOWUP: Why would you choose the superior service?
	- Exactly this kind of results clients want. If the main concern is the cheapest option, then we are not the best fit. Our clients are happy to invest a bit more to get outcomes. So, is the price most important factor for you or is it solving the problem and getting best results?



##### Just give me the cost.

- We have various options to help our clients. As of now, I don't know if I can help you. I'll have to know more about your current situation and where you want to be. Are you against having a conversation around that?
