### What is some asks for a proposal ? 


First step in sales 

1. Understand three things 
	- What is the requirement / problem  they are facing ?
	- What is the urgency?
	- What resources can they allocate to solve the problem?
- ex. - if someone asks for a proposal - don't send it right away, instead try to do 1.
