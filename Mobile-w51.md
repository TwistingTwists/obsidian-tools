Reinforcement learning 
- what is policy and how is it different from replay buffer ? 
- value estimation? - mean value expectation + bellman equation 
- do all actions have rewards ? 
- how to calculate rewards ? - verifiable reward / invariants of the system ?? 

What do we finish on 2025-12-21?
- [x] recording, recordables -- phase 1,4 for the copy-checker
- [ ] tensorzero - routing infra - should we self host that? 
	- [ ] observability + datasets
- [ ] knapsack - subset sum  + 1 more problem  
- [ ] shivani teaching - NCERT - finish one more chapter for her. (1 hr)



### journal of entries 

> JoE -> CoP -> Ledger of Asset / Liability -> Balance Sheet 

JoE : day book

CoP : per Journal E - asset / liability classification


### Asset / Liability heads 

Assets -> subgrouping 
profit = (income - expense)
Asset = Liability + capital + (income - expense)

A + E = L + C + I  for all transactions

(A - L)  - (C + I - E ) = 0 

For a transaction: 
- balance sheet equation is always maintained 
	- examples
		- if L inc , C / I dec => RHS remains the same 
		- one Assset may inc, other may dec


### mapping vendor to asset / liability 

---

journal    - expense + alok kaushik (liability)
payment - cash_reduced + alok kaushik set off 

expense  => cash_reduced

---

payment - cash_reduced + alok kaushik (asset)
journal    - expense + alok_kaushik_set_off  (What if this entry is outside the date when balance sheet is aked -> need to classify asset /liability correclty there?)

expense => cash_reduced

Taking interest in what other people do. 
Level up and ask questions to their level. 


- [x] todo - bugs and enhancements
- [x] no db matching calls - why ? 
- [x] Langfuse integration 
- [x] 20 seconds for the background music stuff 

- [ ] do error handling on 
- [ ] semyon out on calendar a time 
- [ ] idea + asset to storyboard --
	- [ ] idea generation - two more -- 
	- [ ] first frame of first scene will be generated -- 
	- [ ] select assets - 
		- [ ] filter assets - search embedding in assets - search by men / women / ranking etc - top 10 
			- [ ] man men girl boy 
			- [ ] tag=support imagery 
		- [ ] 
		- [ ] and ask llm to filter from 10 images -- 2 good images




- [ ] capability buliding in team ?  - what is the long term goal 
- [ ] share understanding in team 
	- [ ] one projects with hydra heads 
	- [ ] 
- [ ] quarterly plan - goals for the company - as machine 
- [ ] how can you be confident that I will be at staff in one year ? 
- [ ] what are we bad at ? What we need from improve this ? 
- [ ] start with end in mind -- for projects -- 
	- [ ] hypothesis - ML ops, inference etc
	- [ ] experiments
	- [ ] capabilities 
	- [ ] ai video editing --- does the website show that???? 
	- [ ] ai scraping, are we displaying on website? 


What would be a great job???? For projects--- ideal state ? 

Running sheets of experiments 
Goal for the project--- and people should hold me accountable for

How to run experiments? - market validation + pick from domain areas 



Team mode -- 2-3 people  on a project
Writing mode -- accountability statement - public board of improvement 

Capabilities showcase - 
Prs merged in litellm, e2b 


## remote rust job is the only thing I can do now. 
- Database stuff
- 


## education and learning 
- open source repo -> read the PR coments, read the linked issue + comments, read the diff 
- and output a doc with focus on two things 
	- background knowledge needed for the task
	- codebase awareness - the files / paths / patterns needed 
	- and a detailed implementation guide for a junior dev so that he can read the doc, and go step by step and do those changes to create this PR himself. (idea is to make him learn by doing, while highlighting as much contetxt as possible)
	- if there is something that requires lot of context 
		- (for examples, probability basics / compiler basics / database query engine etc -> write a prompt for him so that he can go and study that part himself)


## agent orchestrator cli -- to use free tier very well 
- [ ] agent runner 
	- [ ] Picks a task from the beads cli -> runs amp on certain task / given folders -> write those in docs/work in certain format -> marks update in beads cli
	- [ ] runs hourly -- to ensure max free tokens can be used and the concept can be refined enough.
	- [ ] uses more than one cli to properly manage the auth and credentials ?
