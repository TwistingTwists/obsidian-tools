### Shivani 
- un-necessary items - do not buy
- low quality items - do not buy
- if you think you can sit and do the raaj on my money -- that is not going to happen. you will have to earn this. 
- Are you upgrading yourself to do someting?
	- you will always remain a housewife whose mindset is ONLY to do raj on pati money. Doesn't have aspriations. doesn't want to do anything. that will get you stuff. but won't earn anything. Earning  requires competence and doing good things with your time -- that is not what I see happening. you have one month to improve. 
- Improve what next? -- timing -- wake up and sleep on time. 
	- Do 50 questions daily
- Main padha doonga - but aadat mat banao usko -- use chatgpt to learn , use gemini to learn more. sit for 1 hr daily.

### journal of entries 

> JoE -> CoP -> Ledger of Asset / Liability -> Balance Sheet 

JoE : day book

CoP : per Journal E - asset / liability classification


### Asset / Liability heads 

Assets -> subgrouping 
profit = (income - expense)
Asset = Liability + capital + (income - expense)

A + E = L + C + I  for all transactions

(A - L)  - (C + I - E ) = 0 

For a transaction: 
- balance sheet equation is always maintained 
	- examples
		- if L inc , C / I dec => RHS remains the same 
		- one Assset may inc, other may dec


### mapping vendor to asset / liability 

---

journal    - expense + alok kaushik (liability)
payment - cash_reduced + alok kaushik set off 

expense  => cash_reduced

---

payment - cash_reduced + alok kaushik (asset)
journal    - expense + alok_kaushik_set_off  (What if this entry is outside the date when balance sheet is aked -> need to classify asset /liability correclty there?)

expense => cash_reduced

## remote rust job is the only thing I can do now. 
- Database stuff
- 


## education and learning 
- open source repo -> read the PR coments, read the linked issue + comments, read the diff 
- and output a doc with focus on two things 
	- background knowledge needed for the task
	- codebase awareness - the files / paths / patterns needed 
	- and a detailed implementation guide for a junior dev so that he can read the doc, and go step by step and do those changes to create this PR himself. (idea is to make him learn by doing, while highlighting as much contetxt as possible)
	- if there is something that requires lot of context 
		- (for examples, probability basics / compiler basics / database query engine etc -> write a prompt for him so that he can go and study that part himself)


## agent orchestrator cli -- to use free tier very well 
- [ ] agent runner 
	- [ ] Picks a task from the beads cli -> runs amp on certain task / given folders -> write those in docs/work in certain format -> marks update in beads cli
	- [ ] runs hourly -- to ensure max free tokens can be used and the concept can be refined enough.
	- [ ] uses more than one cli to properly manage the auth and credentials ?

What is the bone to pick with shivani? 
- kid who has not achieved things yet. Needs to step up. Goofing around will not help. Real help needs work. It needs work. 
- 

Usual complaints : 
- she feels ignored when harikesh and Riya are around. She wants to participate too. 
- 'agar mujhe km pyar kroge' to accha ni hoga 
- bluff game - not noticing her bluffs. But noticing bluffs of riya and harikesh 
- 


Is she an interesting person? 
- 

Am I taking her for granted? 


---- 

Why I am stuck! 
- I avoid discomfort wala situations and conversation 
- convenience first mindset. 
- do the growth mindset questionnaire by chatgpt 



----

How do you know you are doing good work? 
- it should feel awesome. That is a criteria. The most important one . Feel of the topic lelo. 

-----

What is the keemat? 
- feel the work. Whatever you do - as a worship. And let it shine you via hanuman ji ka grace. 
- jajbati hoke haar jayenge , but chalaki ni krenge. 
-


More courage to do things. And let people help. 
Courage is from diaphagm 

Inner devta - Jo socha/ chaha man se - wo hi gaya. 
This is a state of being. With your own truth. 
Focus on morning with alignment. Stretch + some physical work => meditation. => Alignment comes.
