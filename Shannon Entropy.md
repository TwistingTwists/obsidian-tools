but help me build intution on how to think about shannon entropy.

1. what is difference between 0.5 vs 0.4 vs 0.3 == sensitivity

2. how to think about 'desriable' values of shannon entroppy in difference scenaris

3. when should I use shannon entropy -- thinking form first principles.

4. why does it even work? shannon entropy is just the sum of probabilities. why can't we take geometric / harmonic mean or something else?
