### principles / working method discovered this week 
- Do not take oral feedback from ritesh. he keeps citing random issues from past that you might have hard time dealing with


### points to think about: 
- Should I make website for Vishal? 


#### Not Urgent Not Important

- s3 + cedar = your own google drive implementation
	- what are the hard questions that can make this system work at scale? 
	- Why you want to do this ? is this solving a hard problem for someone?
