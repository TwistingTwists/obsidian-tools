5. YOGA review 
	1. Shoulders back and resting in hips. discovered a new way to breathe while lying down -- possibly due to gym -- which helped strengthen the chest and thus help with breathing -- giving shoulders necessary relaxation
	2. writing / reading about yoga --- light on yoga and restoring prana books -- makes my breathing calm and incites flow state. I need to do it more. 
		1. Writing about it help as well. Just more concentration. Things flow rather easily. --- do it longer :)
