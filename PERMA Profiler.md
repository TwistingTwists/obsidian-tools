The PERMA Profiler is an excellent choice for exploring well-being and life satisfaction. Let me walk you through what it is and how you can use it to clarify your life goals.

## What is the PERMA Profiler?

The PERMA Profiler is a scientifically validated assessment tool developed by Dr. Martin Seligman and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania. It measures the five core elements of psychological well-being and happiness:

- **P - Positive Emotion**: Experiencing positive feelings like joy, contentment, and hope
- **E - Engagement**: Being completely absorbed in activities, experiencing "flow"
- **R - Relationships**: Having positive, supportive connections with others
- **M - Meaning**: Feeling that your life has purpose and you contribute to something greater than yourself
- **A - Accomplishment**: Pursuing and achieving goals, experiencing mastery and success

The assessment typically includes about 15-20 questions rated on a scale (usually 0-10), asking how much you experience these elements in your life.
