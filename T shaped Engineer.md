Map your skill graph: what are you expert in, what related domains have you only touched superficially? Pick one or two adjacent domains and commit to becoming conversant. If you’re a back-end database specialist, get comfortable with a modern front-end framework or learn ML pipeline basics. Do a small project in your weak area with AI assistance. Integrate your deep expertise with new contexts; if you specialize in web app performance, explore how those skills apply to ML inference optimization. Advocate for or design your role to be more cross-functional. Volunteer to be the “integration champion” for projects touching multiple areas. Mentor others to spread skills around while picking up something from them in return. Update your resume to reflect versatility. Use your experience to identify patterns and transferable knowledge. Become the T-shaped role model: deep in your specialty (giving authority and confidence) but actively stretching horizontally.
