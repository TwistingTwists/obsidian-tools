#### OLAP vs OLTP

(video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhE1skm0y7k]

1. OLAP - min indexes (because ad hoc queries)
2. accelerate database queries
   1. use GPU to parallelise workers - PG Storm
   2. Columnar storage - Citus
3. Trade off in using indexes in database
   1. indexed data can be queries fast
   2. each time data changes, index needs to change
4. so for acceleration, use columnar storage engines (CSE) - they store columns separately - if you only need data from 4 columns out of 200 columns , best to use CSE. Otherwise, each row is read from disk, then filetered for 4 columns. so, if you have a lot of joins - you are doing a 'full table scan'

### Partition vs indexes
Q: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43508486/sql-server-partitioning-vs-indexes
A:


Q: Why partition?
A: The primary use for table partitioning is to speed up bulk data loading and archiving.
Partitioning is never done for_ query performance_. With partitioning the performance will always be worse, the best you can hope for is no big regression, but never improvement.
