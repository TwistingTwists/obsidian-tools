2025-02-04 02:07:49
**Hypothesis:** _If we offer [solution] to [target market] that addresses [specific problem], then [desired outcome, e.g., increased efficiency, reduced costs, improved experience] will occur, leading to [measurable benefit, e.g., user growth, revenue increase]._

- Questions
	- Fav company
	- Inspires most
	- Fav person

- What if I fail at a startup? - valuable things in money and career - knowing people (network) and knowing yourself (strength play)
- Know more people
- Know yourself better

Listen

Fresh eyes

focus

Cornering velocity

Making difference

3 things to look out when starting a new company - do these fit? - Where can I add value (contribute)?

Unit economics

Who your customer are?

What your edge is?

What DO YOU WANT?

people you work with

Money

Work you do - love it, contributes to the world?

When starting out – advantage?

Your perspective - focus on that

Perspective gives problems => if you solve enough of those problems then you have the startup

In most cases - you create more value than you capture(for yourself via a startup ) . Always.

Talk to customers -> how

Be entirely OPEN with your startup ideas = this is not the edge

Your ideas suck! – ideas that have not met customers / people etc = are not solidified enough -> not worth going after

You are not the first person to think of that idea. Someone tried and failed. But why? Find that out.

More you talk - maybe you can find it out the failure modes

Ideal crystallisation - happened in you over a period of time. So even if you tell that idea to someone, don’t worry. Their mental model is not as rich.

Necessities of startup - learn to keep lights on

Don’t die - make payrolls

Learn how VC works

Venture deals - cycles, stages, market conditions

In best case scenarios - VC find you. YOu don’t find VC.

Before going to VC, Find the angle = 30 seconds script for ‘what the path for capturing exponential outcome is’

Understand ZIRP - Zero interest rate phoenomenon

Repo rate - capital flows => money can flow in to fund growth. (so you get we work, and other nonsense companies that become $bn just because money is so much !! and they capture 0.1-1% of it)

Locate and charge your network

Force multiplier (love dad :) )

Right (person / sentence / suggestion) at right time

Charge your network

Talk about it. They want to help you

Show progress to the world! - build in public

Understand your runway

Credibly tight grip on your runway

Financial runway

Personal relationship runway – relationships go up or down based on whether to invest time in them. So be careful there. Renewable resource!!

Emotional runway - people burn out

Be AI ready

Being AI founder

‘Edge’ hai ?

RAG / – they might be eventually be commodotized - what you can build?

Definitely use AI as much as you can to build daily stuff. So that your intuition keeps refining.

  

Being founder in AI world

Commidotised AI products - use and run

What value does YC give you?

Founder’s union => bargaining power as founder => since VC write the terms of raising capital

Network

  

WIN ON EXECUTION

Find edge and POLISH it - polish is the promise

People are buying the future value of what you can build for them. They are not *only* buying what you have

How to make friends? - optimise loop

Why people don’t like you?

And they like you

### Confidence 
1. Rigorous thinking
2. Validation


### Apps you want to build  
1. Prelims quiz portal with reminders 
2. Spaced repetition and layout of syllabus 
3. News Article:
	1. generate quiz based on that. 
	2. generate mains question / prelims question - extract mains relevant / prelims relevant stuff from it. 
4. 
5. 
## Funding - pitch

1. 'this is a machine' -> put money and it will work better for 'many many ' use cases

# Sahil's Course - Minimalist Problem

Goal : doing 100% of time what you want. 
Way to reached goal: Building a (many) profitable businesses.
### 001 Generating Ideas

Approaches to generating ideas: 
* market first - opportunity first
* bottom up - solve your own problem



Which is why the ultimate mantra of software engineering remains "Functionality is an asset, code is a liability".


 FEDS test – for new shiny programming language.

**F**it — Is it known to be a good fit for the job at hand? e.g. implementing a queue in MySQL vs implementing it on Redis. **E**ffort in maintenance & learning — Can we expect a random developer to maintain it 6 quarters from now without complete context? Can we expect the current team to pick this up to a reasonable extent of prowess in a reasonable bounded time? **D**evelopment Velocity — Does it offer us sufficient velocity speedup in the long run to account for the tradeoff of learning a new tool. e.g. We wanted to connect to Google AdManager APIs, and it had a perfectly implemented first-party library in python, so we code this service in python, no questions asked. **S**cale — Is it provably known to perform at scale? Citations from other developers, followed by internal benchmarks, followed by a barebones implementation, and then a phased rollout.

### First time founders

Weaknesses : 
1. 

### Billion Dollar Single person company

- [ ] How to ? 
- [ ] 

### Learn to sell 

- [ ] Story telling - michael dicks book - [[Storyworthy]]
- [ ] What does the customer want? 

### Building specific knowledge

- [ ] Can build websites fast
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

### [Criteria ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lJKucu6HJc&t=9s)for a startup to be successful (30% mostly) : 

* 80% =  people can tell the difference spot-on. Simple to explain.
* Start in small market and market will grow exponentially
* Real trend vs fake trend
	* <span class="take-note"  > real trend</span> == people use the product. 
	* have 10 users who use your product for 3-4 hours a day.
* One person whose enthusiasm is infectious. 
	* Grow more ambitious over time.
* Confident and definite = courage of conviction. 
	* be flexible. you are most likely wrong.
* Team - you need optimists. 
	* You need to believe. and more people that believe.
	* `I've got it!` - Attitude. (Shen)
* Idea generators - at least some of them. 
	* Constantly throwing new ones => remove `unknown unknowns `
* Momentum
	* never loose momentum
	* keep winning at regular short predictable intervals
* competitive advantage over time
	* network effect?
	* 
* Sensible business model ?
* distribution strategy ?
* Why startups win? - over a big company.
	* one no and one yes. - <span class="reading"> Ideas that sound bad but are good. </span> 
	* you are a startup - you need one yes. Other companies will need lots of yes to implment it. So you win by moving fast.
* markets change => you change
	* we are going ALL IN in this new direction.
* 


## TigerStyle

* Define Goals - in order. 
* Solver for 2nd order problems first.
* Actively think and spend the mental energy upfront. -> so much that the implementation is dwarfed by the design.

No technical debt?
