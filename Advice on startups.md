### [Criteria ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lJKucu6HJc&t=9s)for a startup to be successful (30% mostly) : 

* 80% =  people can tell the difference spot-on. Simple to explain.
* Start in small market and market will grow exponentially
* Real trend vs fake trend
	* <span class="take-note"  > real trend</span> == people use the product. 
	* have 10 users who use your product for 3-4 hours a day.
* One person whose enthusiasm is infectious. 
	* Grow more ambitious over time.
* Confident and definite = courage of conviction. 
	* be flexible. you are most likely wrong.
* Team - you need optimists. 
	* You need to believe. and more people that believe.
	* `I've got it!` - Attitude. (Shen)
* Idea generators - at least some of them. 
	* Constantly throwing new ones => remove `unknown unknowns `
* Momentum
	* never loose momentum
	* keep winning at regular short predictable intervals
* competitive advantage over time
	* network effect?
	* 
* Sensible business model ?
* distribution strategy ?
* Why startups win? - over a big company.
	* one no and one yes. - <span class="reading"> Ideas that sound bad but are good. </span> 
	* you are a startup - you need one yes. Other companies will need lots of yes to implment it. So you win by moving fast.
* markets change => you change
	* we are going ALL IN in this new direction.
* 


## TigerStyle

* Define Goals - in order. 
* Solver for 2nd order problems first.
* Actively think and spend the mental energy upfront. -> so much that the implementation is dwarfed by the design.

No technical debt?
