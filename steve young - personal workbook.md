Once you provide these details, I will build a personalized Steve Young Operating System for you.


📘 THE INTERNAL ALIGNMENT WORKBOOK
Based on the principles of Steve Young & Performance Psychology


PART 1: THE FEAR AUDIT ("Running Toward the Spike")
Steve Young says we usually procrastinate or underperform because we are avoiding a specific pain. We need to name the pain to defeat it.
1. The Avoidance: What is one important task, conversation, or project you have been delaying or dreading this week?
> Answer: working on answer mentor project (my own side project )
> 
2. The Catastrophe: If you did that task and it went horribly wrong, what is the specific "worst-case scenario" you are imagining? (e.g., "I look stupid," "They fire me," "I lose money.")
> Answer: I waste time that I could have used for self reflection, spending with my wife, spending with my parents. Anyways that project won't make me lot of money anyway. My interest lies only because I want to see the limits of the LLM workflows combined with domain knowledge and what they are capabile of. 
> 
3. The Exposure: If that worst-case scenario actually happened, would you survive it? What would you do the next day?
> Answer: there is not a SINGLE moment of the worst case scenario. It is more of a creep in phenomenon where I accept not spending time with family as new normal. 


PART 2: THE SCOREBOARD RESET (Process vs. Outcome)
Anxiety comes from trying to control things you can't (The Score). Confidence comes from mastering what you can (The Process).
4. The Obsession: What is the "Score" you are currently worried about? (e.g., "Getting the promotion," "My wife being happy," "Closing the deal.")
> Answer: revenue from project , time commitment 
> 
5. The Input: Since you cannot force that result, what are the 3 specific behaviors (The Process) entirely within your control that influence that result?
>  * Input A: ship the v1 amongst friends. 
>  * Input B: promote it internally ar vertexcover and among friends. 
>  * Input C: utilise time to prepare  for atlassian interviews


PART 3: THE IMPOSTER AUDIT
We often feel like frauds because we compare our "rookie" interior to everyone else's "veteran" exterior.
6. The Fraud Factor: In which specific area of your life (work or personal) do you feel "unqualified" or like you are "faking it"?
> Answer:
> 
7. The Reframing: If you accepted that you are a "Rookie" in this specific area, what is the one advantage that gives you? (e.g., "I ask better questions," "I have no bad habits," "I am hungrier.")
> Answer:


PART 4: THE NARRATIVE FILTER (Data vs. Drama)
Steve Young emphasizes separating the "tape" (what actually happened) from the "story" (what you tell yourself it means).
8. The Story: What is a negative thought you’ve had about yourself or your work in the last 24 hours? (e.g., "I'm not productive enough," "My team doesn't respect me.")
> Answer: 
> 
9. The Evidence: Look at the "game tape." What is the actual, objective data that supports or contradicts this? (Be a cold lawyer for the facts.)
> Answer:
>
