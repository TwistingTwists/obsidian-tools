- digital course business -- plateau stuff 
- other business - scales better

#### GOAL 
- if you want 500M building exit => not the education business 
	- education business BIG (> 10M / yr) are verrrry less. 
		- 30M / year =>  <20 exist
		- 100M / year => > 30 yrs, <5 exist
	- 1-10 M / yr => fastest way to get there is education business! 
- What problems are you comfortable solving?


#### education business 
- hard to turn into asset 
	- people learn and they leave - recurring how? => new people
	- you generate leads, you create the value, you deliver the value 
		- LEADS  - delegate
		- CREATE and DELIVER value - still you! - hard to scale
- find out 'special' about you
- if you want to scale => build brand over time => how? - good quality over time, consistently. Not marginally better, WAYY better. 
 
#### Other business
- if you are doing 3-4M / yr => enough skill to teach a beginner. but not to be a master?
	- bottleneck : can get a team of 10 worker + 1 manager. but can't hire leaders to scale up from 5 to 25 locations = need another layer of leadership?
- Asset - the business does not rely on YOU to run.
	- LEAD  gen
	- CREATE value
	- DELIVER value
	  all 3 steps are done by not 'solely' you. => sellable business
- downsides 
	- intially slow 
	- capex more
- upsides 
	- create asset => requires less of you over time!

don't be so excited. it is just a normal thing. you will get used to it.

Commit -- meaning, remove all the other alternatives. Like marriage. commit to one person.
focus -- measure of amount of things you say not to.

questions for self:

- Can you hire 10 people who can work?
- can you hire the middle leadership layer? - do you understand what leadership even means?
