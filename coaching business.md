#### GOAL 
- if you want 500M building exit => not the education business 
	- education business BIG (> 10M / yr) are verrrry less. 
		- 30M / year =>  <20 exist
		- 100M / year => > 30 yrs, <5 exist
	- 1-10 M / yr => fastest way to get there is education business! 
- What problems are you comfortable solving?


#### education business 
- hard to turn into asset 
	- people learn and they leave - recurring how? => new people
	- you generate leads, you create the value, you deliver the value 
		- LEADS  - delegate
		- CREATE and DELIVER value - still you! - hard to scale


#### Other business
- if you are doing 3-4M / yr => enough skill to teach a beginner. but not to be a master?
- Asset -
