Decision traces = are important tool for the non-deterministic systems to reveal. 
so is time travel = how can they intervene 

for a system of record, this might be important (UX wise) to revisit any 'event' in past decision trace -> and take alternate route (and have the new decision trace linked to the old one) -- along with the actor which executed the new one and why. 

-> the fork in the decision trace becomes a crucial data point -> for training the loop, in memory (tribal) knowledge of the organisation. 
-> most important / often-used decision traces can then become workflows. deterministic and (reliable with metrics and reporting around them?? )
-> a good isolation boundary over the 'system of record' => allows for running multiple workflows as business transactions and commiting transactions (tigerbeetle?)
	- ISOLATION : like agentfs -> versionable data and revisitable becomes important -- because that is how visibility rules are setup (think transactions)
