1. assigns -- updating values (calculated in render function)

```elixir
def abs(assigns) do
    here = "hi #{assigns[:name]}"

     ~H"""
    here -> doesn't update work here
     """
end





this works

def abs(assigns) do

     ~H"""

     <%= here = "hi #{assigns[:name]}" %>

    here -> does work here
     """
end



this also work
def abs(assigns) do
    here = Map.put(assigns, :here, "hi #{assigns[:name]}")
     ~H"""

    @here
     """
end

```
