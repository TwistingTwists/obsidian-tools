Toying with the idea of making an SEO led business. I think SEO / marketing is the ONLY business that can run on-its-own with minimal sustained effort. To that end, I also think it might produce peanuts (not sure atm.)

SEO / affiliate marketing is sitting in middle -- seller wants to sell. buyers are looking for something. you help the buyer reach the seller. 

Fundamental of marketing - from Wiz - is that you know what the audience wants and then connect to it. Have something to sell. Somethimes, marketing is about making noise. once you have made noise, people start paying attention to what you have to offer. if it is good, it sells. word of mouth is the biggest seller afterwards. 





What are the other businesses that can achieve the same?

Hell yes or no book - what would you do if you were not doing it for the money / fame etc. ?

vipassana I need ot do more. I've realised I don't put in enough work and expect results early. that was the same in UPSC. it is same in vipassana. i tone down my exepctations , self-evaulate myself as 'average' dimwit weak lack of courage etc etc , just because I don't want to put in thte work needed. that is not good. Must put in the work. if it 


biggest hinderance to that is 'man ni krta'-- which means -- connection to the thing is missing. to god is missing. so, in theory, if I can be ONLY connected to god, everything else will fall in place. I will be making right effort / sustained effort in places which are most important in life. 

Bu the way, wirting helps me drain out a lot of things from my system out to the paper, I can ssee this, I think slower because my hands need to work that fast. they can. but limiting to 50 wpm is in itself a kinda achievement. slow but long 5=1- min thinking session. 

nice. 

should do this more often. 
one more rule is that I cannot talk about what I wrote today. until 25 hours .
