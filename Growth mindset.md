Awesome — let’s start by mapping where you are now, what you want, and what’s most in the way, then turning that into a plan you can actually follow.

1) Quick self-assessment (10 minutes)

Answer these honestly on a 0–10 scale (0 = rarely/never, 10 = consistently). Write the number + 1–2 examples.

A. Beliefs & self-talk

1. Ability is improvable: When I struggle, I assume I can get better with practice.
  8/10 
  Recently in product management 

2. Effort = strategy-finding (not just “try harder”): I look for better approaches, not just more willpower.
6/10
Effort first, then strategy. Usually, to eliminate that I am not being lazy. 


3. Identity flexibility: I don’t label myself (“I’m not a math person / I’m bad at people”).
4/10 
I am bad at communications. I am bad at managing people. 

4. Failure = information: I can sit with mistakes without spiraling into self-judgment.
6/10 
Failure is fine. I do meditate to gain some strength and fight back with plan. 
I went all in when I had to get a job in elixir. 


B. Behavior under pressure

5. Challenge-seeking: I choose tasks that stretch me, not only ones I can nail.

4/10 
In recent job - preferring to get easy tasks that can be done easily. Down level and deliver is more important than picking up ambiguous tasks and struggling hard. 


5. Feedback appetite: I actively seek feedback (not just tolerate it).

8/10 
Yes. This is most important. 


5. Defensiveness recovery: If I feel defensive, I can recover quickly and get curious.
7/10
Strong woreded feedback came in recently. I listed down a plan for next two weeks. Got 3 wow for my customers. 
Took a lot of effort. 

6. Consistency: I return to practice even after a “bad day.”
7/10 
I recognise this is important. But hard to practice. Dont have a system around this. 


C. Learning skills (the “how”)

9. Deliberate practice: I break skills into parts and practice the weak spots.
8/10 
Almost always 

10. Reflection loops: I routinely review what worked/what didn’t and update my approach.
3/10
Have excel sheet for tracking this, but never do this. 

11. Help-seeking: I ask for help early rather than hiding confusion.


12. Transfer: I apply lessons from one situation to another.



D. Social environment (huge for mindset)

13. People I’m around support learning, experimentation, and candor.


14. I create psychological safety for others to learn around me.



Send me your scores (just the numbers is fine) and any 2–3 examples where you felt most stuck recently.

2) Clarify what “growth mindset awareness” means for you

Pick 1–2 focus contexts (this matters because plans differ):

Work performance / career growth

Relationships / communication

Health / fitness

Creativity / side projects

Confidence / anxiety under evaluation


Then answer these 3 prompts in 2–4 lines each:

1. Where do you most want change in the next 8–12 weeks?


2. What would “noticeably better” look like in real life? (behaviors, not feelings)


3. What keeps happening instead? (patterns)

3) How I’ll identify your gaps (and which matter most)

Once I have your scores + context, I’ll map them into a simple prioritization:

The 4 common “gap types”

1. Belief gap: you intellectually agree, but emotionally don’t buy it under stress.


2. Process gap: you want to improve, but don’t have a repeatable learning loop.


3. Trigger gap: certain situations flip you into protection/avoidance (feedback, comparison, failure).


4. Environment gap: incentives/people/culture punish learning behaviors.



“Most important” = biggest leverage

We’ll prioritize gaps that:

show up frequently

have high cost

are easy to instrument (we can measure & improve quickly)

unlock multiple areas (spillover)

4) A starter plan you can begin today (before you send scores)

This is a “minimum viable system” that works for most people and becomes customized after your assessment.

Daily (5 minutes)

The 3-line loop

Trigger: “What situation nudged me into fixed mindset today?”

Story: “What was I telling myself?”

Reframe + next action: “What’s a growth interpretation + one small step?”


Example:
Trigger: teammate questioned my idea
Story: I’m not respected / I’m not smart
Reframe: they’re stress-testing; I can sharpen
Next action: ask 1 clarifying question + revise 1 slide

2× per week (20 minutes)

Deliberate practice block

Choose 1 skill tied to your context (e.g., giving feedback, writing, prioritization, negotiation).

Split it into a micro-skill.

Practice it with a constraint (timer / template / rehearsal).

Capture 1 metric (even subjective: 1–10 clarity, # of times you asked for feedback, etc.)


Weekly (30 minutes)

Review + design

What did I avoid? Why?

What worked?

What will I do differently next week?

Pick one “stretch” for the week + one “support” (habit/environment).


This is the backbone. After your assessment, I’ll tailor:

the specific triggers you’re working with

the scripts you use when you notice them

the learning drills that match your goals

the effort level per area (some areas need reps; others need exposure therapy; others need environment changes)

5) Light references (what I’m drawing from)

Carol Dweck’s work on mindsets and praise/interpretations (foundational framework).

“Deliberate practice” research (Anders Ericsson and related work): improvement = targeted reps + feedback loops.

Psychological safety + learning culture research (Amy Edmondson): environment shapes learning behaviors.


(We’ll keep references light like this unless you want deeper links/titles.)

Your turn (reply in one message)

1. Your 0–10 scores for questions 1–14


2. Pick 1–2 contexts (work/relationships/etc.)


3. Answer the 3 prompts in Section 2



Then I’ll come back with:

where you are strongest

your top 2–3 gaps (ranked)
