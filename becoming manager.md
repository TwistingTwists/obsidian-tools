Congratulations on becoming a manager! It is a transition that requires a complete rewiring of how you view "work."

Shreyas Doshi’s list is excellent, but it is high-level philosophy. To survive your first year, you need to operationalize that philosophy.

Here is a framework to turn those 15 principles into **actionable habits** and **trackable metrics**, organized by the rhythm of your work.

---

### Phase 1: The Weekly Rhythm (Tactical Management)
*Focus: Points 1, 2, 8, 9, 14*

**Actionable Habits:**
1.  **The 30/70 Rule (Point 2):** In 1:1s, force yourself to speak only 30% of the time. If you catch yourself lecturing, stop and ask, "What is your perspective on this?"
2.  **The "Socratic" Pivot (Point 1):** When a team member brings you a problem, do not offer a solution immediately. Ask: "If I wasn't here, what would be your first step?" or "What are the trade-offs of the two options you're considering?"
3.  **Well-being Check-ins (Point 8):** Start every 1:1 with 5 minutes of non-work conversation. Look for "dissonance" (e.g., they say "I'm fine" but look exhausted).

**How to Track It:**
*   **The "Wait" Count:** Keep a notepad in meetings. Write a checkmark every time you wanted to interrupt but stayed silent.
*   **The Solution Ratio:** At the end of the week, estimate: In how many instances did *I* solve the problem vs. guiding *them* to solve it? (Goal: <50% solved by you).

### Phase 2: The Monthly Rhythm (Strategic People Ops)
*Focus: Points 10, 11, 12, 13*

**Actionable Habits:**
1.  **The "User Manual" Review (Point 11):** Create a document for each report detailing their strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles. Update this monthly. Do not manage everyone the same way.
2.  **Stakeholder Mapping (Point 13):** Identify 3 peers (other managers) or leaders whose cooperation your team needs. Schedule a coffee/zoom with one of them per month with no agenda other than building rapport.
3.  **The Career Separation (Point 10):** Once a month, dedicate a 1:1 *exclusively* to career growth. Banish all talk of current project deadlines from this meeting.

**How to Track It:**
*   **Peer Equity:** Have I met with a peer outside my immediate team this month? (Yes/No)
*   **Career Log:** Check your calendar. Does every direct report have a dedicated "Career Chat" scheduled this month? (Yes/No)

### Phase 3: Decision Making & Standards (The Operating System)
*Focus: Points 3, 5, 7, 9*

**Actionable Habits:**
1.  **The "Company Hat" Test (Point 5 & 7):** When making a decision (budget, hiring, roadmap), write down: "Does this benefit my team but hurt the company?" If yes, don't do it.
2.  **The Root Cause Journal (Point 3):** When a failure happens, do not implement a new "process" immediately. Write down the problem and ask "Why?" five times. Address the root (usually interpersonal or lack of clarity), not the symptom.
3.  **Defining "Done" (Point 9):** Write down your standards. What does "excellent" look like for a code review, a design spec, or a sales call? Share this document. If work doesn't meet the bar, give feedback immediately.

**How to Track It:**
*   **The Process Bloat Check:** Count how many new "rules" or "processes" you created this quarter. If the number is high, you are band-aiding, not leading.
*   **The Hard Conversation Counter:** Have you given constructive (negative) feedback to someone who wasn't meeting standards this month? If the answer is "No," your standards are likely slipping.

### Phase 4: Self-Reflection (The Manager's Mindset)
*Focus: Points 4, 6, 15*

**Actionable Habits:**
1.  **Vulnerability Modeling (Point 14):** Explicitly say "I don't know the answer to that, let's figure it out" at least once a week.
2.  **The "Toxic" Audit (Point 12 & 6):** Review your team's behavior. Is there a "high performer" who is rude to others? If you are tolerating them, you are failing Point 12. Plan a feedback session immediately.
3.  **Writing as a Tool (Point 4):** Before announcing a major change, write a memo. Edit it for clarity and tone (supportive, not weaponized).

**How to Track It:**
*   **The Friday Retro:** Block 15 minutes on Friday afternoon. Rate yourself 1-5 on:
    *   Did I act as an agent of the company?
    *   Did I listen more than I spoke?
    *   Did I clarify context before content?

### Summary: Your "New Manager" Scorecard

If you want to gamify this, create a simple spreadsheet with these columns to fill out every Friday:

| Metric | Goal | Source Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Listening Ratio** | Spoke < 40% in 1:1s | #2 |
| **Question Count** | Asked "What do you think?" 3+ times | #1 |
| **Peer Connection** | 1 non-transactional chat with a peer | #13 |
| **Career Focus** | Discussed growth (not tasks) with 1 person | #10 |
| **Feedback Given** | Gave clear standards-based feedback | #9 |
| **Agency Check** | Said "I don't know" or owned a mistake | #14 |

**Start small.** Pick 3 of these rows to track for your first month. Once they become muscle memory, add more.
