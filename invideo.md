Why this company? 

I am at X. I want to be at Y place. To do that, this company has the best of the resources.


e.g. Why invideo?
- I know elixir / rust. I want to learn AI. What better place to do that other than invideo AI?

I have made my efforts into it. My life's best work is ahead of me. But I know it is ahead of me.
