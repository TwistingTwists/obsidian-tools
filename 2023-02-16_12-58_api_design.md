## API - retry safety in Rust
(blog)[https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/idempotency/#1-post-admin-newsletters-a-refresher]
1. Indempotency of the API = Retry-safety  of API = has a dramatic impact on the ergonomics of an API.
2. synchronization: the second request should not be processed until the first one has completed.
We have two options:

> Reject the second request by returning a 409 Conflict status code back to the caller; but browsers do not automatically retry 409s.
> Wait until the first request completes processing. Then return the same response back to the caller.
