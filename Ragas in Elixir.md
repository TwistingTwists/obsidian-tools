Just a question around structured output using instructor 

https://youtu.be/CeDS1yvw9E4?t=745 : This shows the structured output using llamaindex. Instructor produces similar stuff by defining pydantic models. 

1. does llamaindex use instructor?
2. if not, then Is there tangible benefit by integrating instructor with llamaindex? 
3. the integration might be trivial. Or not. If it is trivial, please point to some docs.
