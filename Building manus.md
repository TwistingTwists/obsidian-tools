I was asked to build a demo for triggering Manus via email. My first instinct was to hack it together with a script. My boss, 潘潘, pushed back: if it's not real, what's the point?

So by the end of that Friday, the demo was actually live. You could email an address and watch a task get triggered. It wasn't feature-complete. But people could use it and that really got everyone excited for this feature.

was maintaining changes to our internal agent framework while also writing production Go for the first time. I learned Go on the job—not from a course, but from immersion. I'd read through PRs to understand how the codebase worked. I'd use AI models to help me parse unfamiliar patterns. I'd try to rebuild things myself just to see if I understood them. And I asked a lot of stupid questions—questions that probably had obvious answers, but asking them got me unstuck faster than pretending I knew what I was doing.

Getting productive in a new language comes down to a few things: read the code before you try to write it, seek feedback constantly, and be wrong fast.
