https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14RLvkzbHFc

- [ ] Regular languages 
	- [ ] Finite Automata + Non deterministic finite automata + REGEX 
	- [ ] Algo about regular languages
	- [ ] closure property of regular languages 
- [ ] Context free languages
	- [ ] Context free grammars = recursive system for generating string
	- [ ] push down automata = generalisation of finite automata 
	- [ ] closure and decision properties
		- [ ] closed under union but not intersection
- [ ] recursive and recursively enumerable languages
	- [ ] Turing Machines , decidability of problems
- [ ] Intractable problems 
	- [ ] problems appear to requiring Exponential time 
	- [ ] NP completeness and beyond 


- [ ] Finite Automaton 
	- [ ] state 
	- [ ] inputs = events
	- [ ] transition
- [ ] [tennis example ](https://youtu.be/ZIsJK81Vb48?list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ33jY4raAXvUT7Bm_S_EGu0&t=459)
	- [ ] state 
		- [ ] start = Love
		- [ ] final = "Server Wins" or "Opponent wins"
		- [ ] 
	- [ ] inputs 
		- [ ] s = server wins a point
		- [ ] o =  opponent wins a point
	- [ ] transition
