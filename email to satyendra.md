Hi Satyendra, 

I have recently received the official document mentioning the final FnF  (full and final) amount from my previous employer. As discussed over the call before, a sum of this was to be adjusted in the joining bonus with Optimum Infosystems. I appreciate the work put forward by you in negotiating the present amount (INR 50k). However, in light of this official document, i would request you to re-consider the joining bonus to help me settle the accounts. 

I recognise this might be an unusual request. Due to request from Optimum Infosystems to join early, I agreed to leave the my previous employer early and the recovery amount is more than I can handle on my own. The recovery amount is nearly **2.66 Lakhs**.

Please do the needful. 

Please find attachment for the FnF statement.
