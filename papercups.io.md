## Notes 

- [ ] HSTS (HTTP strict transport security)- to prevent `301 redirection from http to https` attacks.
	- [ ] visitor’s browser has to see the HSTS header at least once before it can take advantage of it for future visits. This means that they will have to go through the HTTP to HTTPS process at least once, leaving them vulnerable the first time they visit an HSTS-enabled website.
