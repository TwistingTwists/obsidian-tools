**5 Ways to Answer "the above question" using these principles:**

1.  **Focus on Understanding, Not Judging (Chapters 1 & 17):** Instead of jumping to conclusions or criticizing, I would ask questions to understand their perspective and motivations. This approach helps me develop empathy and ensures that I'm not making assumptions. By focusing on their challenges, rather than their actions I can better tailor my interactions with them. 

2.  **Genuine Appreciation and Valuing Others (Chapters 2, 6 & 9):** I would try to identify specific things I appreciate about them, then verbally acknowledge their contributions, by showing them that their voice and presence is important. Remembering their name and using it frequently, will go a long way. I would focus on making them feel valued, not just by showing them but also by the words I choose to speak to them.

3.  **Encouraging Self-Expression (Chapters 7, 15 & 25):** I would listen actively and encourage them to talk about their interests, or a perspective they are considering. Instead of imposing my views, I would ask open-ended questions that allow them to explore solutions. This helps to get them to be invested in the process and find their own way to a result.

4.  **Focusing on Their Needs and Motivations (Chapters 3, 8 & 19):** I would try to understand what motivates them, and tailor my approach to align with their needs and desires. By focusing my interactions on their interests, I can more effectively communicate and collaborate, because I am appealing to them from their perspective.

5.  **Positive Framing and Constructive Approach (Chapters 13, 22, 23 & 28):** When dealing with disagreements, I would start with a friendly approach, highlighting their strengths. If correction is needed, I would do so indirectly, focusing on making them feel that their errors are easily corrected. By focusing on positive aspects, I am encouraging a good outcome.

Feeling heard is important. She has chores to do. And doesn't want to do them. "Man utar gaya hai"

Sharing difficulties of her mental model and life. 

So
### Emotion-Based Motivation
Why, small-step, vision

Future Visioning – “Imagine how good it’ll feel once this is done.”

Self-Compassion Talk – “You don’t have to feel like doing it, you just have to take the first step.”

Identify Her Why – “What’s one reason this matters to you?” Bringing it back to her personal reasons can create motivation.
