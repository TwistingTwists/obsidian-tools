- **How to Use:**
    - **Recognize:** Acknowledge the emotion present without judgment ("I'm feeling anxious.")
    - **Allow:** Let the emotion be there without resistance ("It's okay to feel this way.")
    - **Investigate:** Explore the emotion with curiosity ("What sensations am I experiencing? What thoughts are present?" )
    - **Nurture:** Offer yourself compassion and kindness ("I'm here for myself, even when things are tough.")

[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]


**5 Ways to Answer "the above question" using these principles:**

1.  **Focus on Understanding, Not Judging (Chapters 1 & 17):** Instead of jumping to conclusions or criticizing, I would ask questions to understand their perspective and motivations. This approach helps me develop empathy and ensures that I'm not making assumptions. By focusing on their challenges, rather than their actions I can better tailor my interactions with them. 

2.  **Genuine Appreciation and Valuing Others (Chapters 2, 6 & 9):** I would try to identify specific things I appreciate about them, then verbally acknowledge their contributions, by showing them that their voice and presence is important. Remembering their name and using it frequently, will go a long way. I would focus on making them feel valued, not just by showing them but also by the words I choose to speak to them.

3.  **Encouraging Self-Expression (Chapters 7, 15 & 25):** I would listen actively and encourage them to talk about their interests, or a perspective they are considering. Instead of imposing my views, I would ask open-ended questions that allow them to explore solutions. This helps to get them to be invested in the process and find their own way to a result.

4.  **Focusing on Their Needs and Motivations (Chapters 3, 8 & 19):** I would try to understand what motivates them, and tailor my approach to align with their needs and desires. By focusing my interactions on their interests, I can more effectively communicate and collaborate, because I am appealing to them from their perspective.

5.  **Positive Framing and Constructive Approach (Chapters 13, 22, 23 & 28):** When dealing with disagreements, I would start with a friendly approach, highlighting their strengths. If correction is needed, I would do so indirectly, focusing on making them feel that their errors are easily corrected. By focusing on positive aspects, I am encouraging a good outcome.

Don't judge

- negative words to positive : 
	- Risky  --> bold , strange --> interesting, big step! 
- validate feelings with words

| **Scenario**                                                | **Judgmental Response (Avoid)**                                  | **Non-Judgmental Response (Practice)**                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A friend shares they’re switching careers late in life.** | _"Aren’t you too old to start over? That’s risky."_              | _"That’s a bold move. What inspired you to make this change?"_        |
| **Someone admits they’re struggling emotionally.**          | _"It’s not that big of a deal. You’ll get over it."_             | _"That sounds really tough. How are you feeling about it right now?"_ |
| **A coworker talks about an unconventional hobby.**         | _"Why would you spend your time on that? It seems strange."_     | _"That’s so interesting! What got you into that hobby?"_              |
| **A friend says they’re moving to another country.**        | _"Why would you want to leave everything behind? That’s crazy."_ | _"Wow, that’s a big step. What excites you most about moving?"_       |
| **A family member reveals they’ve made a mistake.**         | _"How could you let that happen? You should’ve known better."_   | _"We all make mistakes. What do you think you’ve learned from it?"_   |

By replacing judgmental responses with open-ended, curious, and empathetic ones, you create space for understanding and meaningful dialogue.
