- **Structure:** This acronym stands for Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Nurture. It encourages a compassionate and non-judgmental approach to your emotional experience.
- **How to Use:**
    - **Recognize:** Acknowledge the emotion present without judgment ("I'm feeling anxious.")
    - **Allow:** Let the emotion be there without resistance ("It's okay to feel this way.")
    - **Investigate:** Explore the emotion with curiosity ("What sensations am I experiencing? What thoughts are present?" )
    - **Nurture:** Offer yourself compassion and kindness ("I'm here for myself, even when things are tough.")
