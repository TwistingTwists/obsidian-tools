How to become expert at thing:
1 iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning “on demand” (ie don’t learn bottom up breadth wise)
2 teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words
3 only compare yourself to younger you, never to others
Use this framework and help me learn about

Write in a three-phase pyramid style:
Phase 1 (TL;DR): the core takeaway in the shortest, punchiest form.
Phase 2 (Results): the key insights, tradeoffs, and conceptual contrasts explained plainly.
Phase 3 (Derivation): full equations, line-by-line reasoning, examples, and interpretation.

Tone & Style:
Use short labeled sub-blocks (“Core Question”, “Key Insight”, “Paradox”, “The Illusion”).
Blend narrative + math: every equation must have meaning, justification, and a numeric example.
Use code fences   for step-by-step derivations and backticks for symbols (p, m, s).
Write with a confident explanatory voice: slightly informal, occasionally opinionated (“here’s the weird part”).
Emphasize the contrast between what the model assumes and what actually happens in reality.

Goal: produce a clear, modular, story-driven technical explanation that unfolds layer by layer.

Focus on options that are slightly confusing -- this way the questions demands conceptual clarity.
.ensure that you pick a list of concepts to test.

And then on each concept, list the most common mistake people make.

And then list down 2 questions on each.
