### Dharmesh 

### Simplicity in business:

1. if you put a feature in, you take a feature out.
2. measure cost of feature = cost of implementation + cost of maintenance + other costs that get added

other costs = added dimensional complexity to entire org.  
all charts / decisions in entire org centre around feature1 and feature2.

#### should you build for SMB? Yes. Because

1. It is hard.
2. Enterprise software : sales cycle is long + revenue concentration => big corps dictate features.

3. Consumer startups: nobody in middle. lol . Either you are fb or you are zero.    

4. B2B : incrementally build value for B. don't have to sell to customers.  
    and that customers don't dictate your feature roadmap.

5. reverse gravity in software: you can be led by your most paying customers and continue focussing on the value you give to them.

  
  

#### Solving problems 

fall in love with problem. not the solution.

as understanding the problem deeper => solution evolves.

there is no free lunch. your problem poses some constraints (given the team / infra ) => stay disciplined at solving problem means sticking to constraints

for hubspot:  
Problem: SMB = difficult to integrate tools

Solution: we integrate. (we need to build things ourselves) but INTEGRATION is the solution. not building the best tool, but the best integration among above avg tools.

  

#### Communication Dharmesh 

hashtags for dharmesh

1. fyi: found this X awesome. just thought I'd share. No response expected.
2. suggestion: I'd consider this if I were you. No pressure to do this. No response expected

3. recommendation: I've done some soul searching, diggin. I will do this if I were in your position. you don't have to do this. If you decide not to do this, please give a response.

4. plea: I've thought about this sooo much. Almost in soul searching way. Please do this.

1. plea : rarely use. Is this a deal you  are willing to die on?
2. using plea is using your 'founder' card. should you waste it on this problem?

  

#### Decision in teams

data doesn't make devisions. people do. data provides insights and builds intuition.

debate decide unite : after decision is done, unite on that decision.

  
  

#### systematically thinking on decisions.

1. if it were excel spreadsheets, what would be the columns? = identify the factors to consider.
    

let a team do this.

2. rate the relative importance of the factors. one may be more important than other. and so on. so you have a ranking among factors now.

amount of calories you spend on making a decision => impact of decision.

#### Doing new things 

##### Action 

default position on most things :NO

Should I go and do this? NO

force myself -- make decision and go do it.

if you say YES to one thing, you are saying NO to a lot of things.

What are the things you are saying no to??

same rule as building new feature = one feature in, one feature out.

  

##### Startup idea 

let's pick a new startup idea

1. potential: 10mn usd
    

2. probability of success: 10% chance
    

CALCULATE POTENTIAL FIRST then calculate probability.

Read probability / markov chain etc

3. Passion / proximity : do you actually care so much about this thing?
    

1. become passionate about the idea later.
    

5. prowess : uniquely positioned (unfair advantage) to pursue this idea?
    

1. evaluating prowess: Why would you succeed? Why that company? Why that only?
    

  
  
  

##### Culture 

A company builds two products. One for the customer. second product for the team that builds the first product.

culture is that second product.

- culture product must be built after talking to people.
    

- Good product keeps evolving. Culture is evolving with people and the company. so, bugs in the culture are identified.
    

some bugs are prioritised and commiteted to be fixed. others are not.

-   
    

challenge in culture:

core values of culture (product)

- transparency - hubspot was able to preserve
    

- flat org - it was a bug in culture
    

Have a culture deck right on.

and put aspirational things there. even if they are not true yet.

as people come and join the org, they will try to stick to those. and manifest it

  

middle ground in culture:

mention the aspirational values and the values org practices today.

That way you can keep both of them visible. A goal to walk upto is there (aspirational values).

  

#### On Success 

success is making people who believed in you look brilliant.
