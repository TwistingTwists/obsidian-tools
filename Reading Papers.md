TL;DR
1.  Finetune your LLM on successful chat sessions w/ humans. During inference generate multiple chat futures and execute the first step of the shortest generated future, like a recursive Dijkstra’s over LLM chat.
2. Only need to fine tune once. Second time fine tuning does not provide much benefit
3.

### Unnatural Instructions: Tuning Language Models with (Almost) No Human Labor [Source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09689.pdf)

TL;DR
1. Unnatural Instructions: a large dataset of creative and diverse instructions, collected with virtually no human labor.
	1. 240,000 examples of instructions, inputs, and outputs.
2. Generates examples via the LLM => measures the *correctness* and *diversity* of generated data
	1. covers variety of tasks - like Question Answering, Sentiment Analysis, Arithmetic, Geometry, Event Ordering, Puzzles, etc
	2. correctness = 56% instructions
	3. incorrect = 5% incomprehensible, 18% output does not match the task given , 20% incorrect output
	4. Diversity = via BERTScore
3. FineTune the T5-LLM model
