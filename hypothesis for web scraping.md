What do we believe to be true about web scraping? - how it should be done? 
- every web page calls a few api on the backend. just figure those out and emulate those to get the data from the backend.
	- done that for listing data that is unauthenticated 
- potentially, web browser agents should be able to 
	- point, click
	- fetch data from backend (curl style) to debug


What are we doing about it?
