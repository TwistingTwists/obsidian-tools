What questions do you ask? 

- New - broad
    
- Depth - interesting
    

**



Timer - upgrade - global id on timer setting 

data structure -> at least one entry in data structure, there is no processing needs to be done.
If insert in data structure : 
settimeout -> exponential backoff 

settimeout vs setinterval 

sys-call are expensive - timer. can we reduce timer calls?





#### Liveview 

E.g. I have `app_live/shuffle.ex` and `app_live/shuffle.html.heex` and then I have `demo_live/shuffle.ex` and want that to also render `app_live/shuffle.html.heex`

---
```elixir
def render(assigns) do
  OtherLiveView.render(assigns)
end

```
