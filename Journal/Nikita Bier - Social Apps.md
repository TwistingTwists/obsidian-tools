| Habit formation requires recurring organic exposure on other networks. Said another way: after people install your app, they need to see your content elsewhere to remind them that your app exists (e.g., Instagram photos on Facebook, TikTok videos on Instagram)<br> |             |
| <br>If you can't use your app from the toilet or while distracted—like driving—your users will have few opportunities to form a habit. There is a graveyard of live video apps that didn't make it because of the attention they require.<br>                            |             |
| Great products take off by targeting a specific life inflection point, when the urgency to solve a problem is most acute. Facebook ➝ Starting at a school Linkedin ➝ Getting your 1st job Slack ➝ Starting a company                                                     |             |
| does it ask for 7 other people to open the app ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |
| The majority of new app installs take place in bed or on the toilet. If your app requires sound-on or voice to sign up, you’ve voluntarily accepted a 60% tax on your growth.                                                                                            |             |
| We tend to overcomplicate what it means to have great product sense. To put it simply: you can look at a screen and intuitively predict the percent of users who will convert to the next screen within a 10% margin of error                                            |             |


#### TBH described its methods as “too ‘scrappy’” for a big company.

nikita's methods

 We designed a novel method that was reproducible, albeit non-scalable.
  For example, when using Facebook’s _Quick Promos_ (or QPs), we should avoid providing an instant download link. Instead, we should request push notification permission to alert the targeted users at a later date. That way, we can collect their interest and contact them simultaneously to ensure critical mass during launch hour

Give less freedom to people - [lol here](https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1926295017619939743)
