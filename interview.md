### Advise 

1. do something that you don't think you can do.

> When you practice music, it shouldn’t sound good. If you always sound
good during practice sessions, it means you’re not stretching your lim-
its. That’s what practice is for.

2. Stand on shoulder of giants

>  Sometimes we would play name
that improviser where one of us would play a recording of an impro-
vised solo and the rest of us would have to figure out, based on style,
who the recorded improviser was.

## Learnings from Project IAS 
### Senior Engineer (Manager) - Domain Knowledge

* NMS project  - stakeholder approach 
* Manage teams - with subordinates and upper management  - process and tools - 
* Domain 
	* Embedded : Launchboard + FTDI module + C language firmware + alpine + RF module (design + fabrication both in India + testing in our own lab)
	* IoT :  MQTT brokers (vernemq)
	* RF communication : mesh formation  ( 865 - 867 MHz, 868 also trying to include since this is unlicensed band {free ISM band} ) + Wireshark etc for debugging
	* Meter : DLMS protocol (IS 15959) + OBIS codes (400+ worked on)

## Gaps to fill
1. How to design a good HTTP Client ? - Hardhat + Req + telemetry + fuse?
2. Learn Ecto from firezone github project 
3. Supavisor - commit by commit 
4. [Binaries and Elixir](binary_pattern_matching) 
5. [Concurrency in Elixir](concurrent_elixir) 


### Mentoring yourself

Here’s a way to proxy-mentor yourself.

Think of the person in your field whom you admire most. Most
of us have a short list already formulated from some stage in
our careers. It may be someone we’ve worked with, or it may
be someone whose work we admire. List the ten most important
attributes of this role model. Choose the attributes that are the
reason why you have chosen this person to be your role model.
These attributes might be specific areas of skill, such as technol-
ogy breadth, or the depth of their knowledge in some particular
domain. Or, they might be more personal traits like the ability to
make team members comfortable or that they are an engaging
speaker.
Now, rank those qualities in order of importance, with 1 being the
least important and 10 being the most important. You have now
created and distilled a list of attributes that you find admirable
and important. These are the ways in which you should strive to
emulate your chosen role model. But, how do you choose which
to focus on first?
Add a column to the list, and for each item on the list, imagine how
your role model would rate you on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the
best). Try to really put yourself into the mind of your role model and
to observe yourself as if a third person.
When you have the attributes, ranking, and your own ratings, in a
final column subtract your rating in each row from the importance
level you gave it in the preceding column. If you ranked something
as 10, the most important attribute of your role model, and your
rating was 3, that gives you a final priority score of 7. Having filled
this column in completely, sorting in descending order will you give
a prioritized top ten list of areas in which you need to improve.
Start with the top two or three items, and put together a concrete
list of tasks you can start doing now to improve yourself
