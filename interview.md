 Feedback is the process of informing a person about behaviors that should be changed to improve a process.

#### Prepare 
1. Should I give feedback? 

| Roles   | _How might your role influence the feedback?_<br>    <br>    - _Are you providing feedback to a colleague?_<br>        <br>    - _As an EM, are you giving feedback to one of your team members?_<br>        <br>    - _As a developer, are you giving feedback to your EM?_ |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Context | Situation - location , observed behaviour<br><br>Events leading upto observed behaviour <br><br>- "What was going on when this behavior happened?"<br>- “Is there a clear pattern in this behavior?”<br>- "Could their background or personal life have something to do with it?"<br>- "How might my own perceptions or biases be influencing how I view the behavior?"<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |


#### Communicate

| Behaviour | Focus on the exact behaviour + use direct words to explain    |
| --------- | --- |
| Impact          |     |


## Team lead? 

1. Project lead? 
2. Problem Aaya / Solution 
	1. Timely - Daily sync up to remove blockers that they might have had.
	2. Gannt Chart - 
	3. 



## Disagreements 

I never liked the statement for work - "Let's agree to disagree".  
  
It could be an sign of failed communication.  
  
Maybe I dismissed someone else's perspective or didn't listen to them.  
  
To address this, I:  
  
- Ensure we understand and discuss the reasons for our disagreements.  
- Perhaps we weigh different intuitive factors differently. Maybe we are missing data.  
- Reflect on whether I am rushing the conversation to avoid a difficult discussion.  
- Let go if the topic is not crucial or the consequences are minor.  
- Try hard to never end the conversation on a sour note.

### Remote.com 

#### Introduce yourself

I am a passionate software developer with more than 4 years of experience and with Elixir as primary language during 2.5 . 

I have had diverse experience using Elixir across backend, frontend and even LiveBook recently for internal dashboard tooling. 

During my last stint at Tinymesh, I have nurtured a team of juniors in elixir to help them gain experienced and be productive. We are more like a pro-sports team. I believe that giving feedback with care and effective communication are keys for a team to punch above their weight. 

I believe working with right people / teams makes a great work place not the free perks. Some of the best people who I lookup to, in Elixir Community have been at remote.com . That inspires me to join remote.com 


If you like, I can go on in more technical details on 

I have recently started contributing back to the elixir community when I can. I would love to give back more as time permits.

#### Why Remote.com ? 

First, friends referred me to this who have previously worked there. 

Second, I like the process from what I have gathered from the Remote Handbook and Interview Process. It is pretty detailed. 

Third, remote.


Questions: 
2. ProjectIAS went down in covid. How to verify ?

### 3 stage process
#### General tips 
1. pause after answer 
2. stick to qusetion 
3. show motivation 
4. 
### Advise 

1. do something that you don't think you can do.

> When you practice music, it shouldn’t sound good. If you always sound
good during practice sessions, it means you’re not stretching your lim-
its. That’s what practice is for.

2. Stand on shoulder of giants

>  Sometimes we would play name
that improviser where one of us would play a recording of an impro-
vised solo and the rest of us would have to figure out, based on style,
who the recorded improviser was.

### Mentoring yourself

Here’s a way to proxy-mentor yourself.

Think of the person in your field whom you admire most. Most
of us have a short list already formulated from some stage in
our careers. It may be someone we’ve worked with, or it may
be someone whose work we admire. List the ten most important
attributes of this role model. Choose the attributes that are the
reason why you have chosen this person to be your role model.
These attributes might be specific areas of skill, such as technol-
ogy breadth, or the depth of their knowledge in some particular
domain. Or, they might be more personal traits like the ability to
make team members comfortable or that they are an engaging
speaker.
Now, rank those qualities in order of importance, with 1 being the
least important and 10 being the most important. You have now
created and distilled a list of attributes that you find admirable
and important. These are the ways in which you should strive to
emulate your chosen role model. But, how do you choose which
to focus on first?
Add a column to the list, and for each item on the list, imagine how
your role model would rate you on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the
best). Try to really put yourself into the mind of your role model and
to observe yourself as if a third person.
When you have the attributes, ranking, and your own ratings, in a
final column subtract your rating in each row from the importance
level you gave it in the preceding column. If you ranked something
as 10, the most important attribute of your role model, and your
rating was 3, that gives you a final priority score of 7. Having filled
this column in completely, sorting in descending order will you give
a prioritized top ten list of areas in which you need to improve.
Start with the top two or three items, and put together a concrete
list of tasks you can start doing now to improve yourself


### How to view a company?
A lot of companies think of themselves like a family. We are not a family. *We are like a pro sports team*. Families mean unconditional love. Once born in to the family you are part of it forever. A great team is about pushing yourself and your teammates, caring intensively about the team. It is about performance and not seniority or how long you have been with the team. Yet unlike in a family players know they will not play for the team forever. A team can only be as good as its weakest member. That’s why a great coach will always try to have the best players on every position.
