:: 1. Change the dot bullet to standard markdown dash
"^•\s*"->"- "

:: 2. Remove lines that contain only whitespace (cleans up the gaps)
"^\s*\n"->"EMPTY"x

:: 3. Bold the Key terms (matches text between the dash and the first colon)
"^-\s*(.+?):"->"- **$1:**"

:: 4. Ensure there is a blank line before the very first list item (for header separation)
"(?<!\n)\n- "->"\n\n- "
