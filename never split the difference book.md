| **Introduction: The New Rules**                                         | Traditional negotiation tactics are flawed. Emphasizes emotional intelligence and tactical empathy.                                                              | FBI negotiations prioritize understanding emotions over logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                            |
| **1. The New Rules**                                                    | Negotiation is not about logic but about emotions. Active listening and empathy are key.                                                                         | In a hostage situation, showing empathy calms the suspect and increases cooperation.                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                            |
| **2. Be a Mirror**                                                      | Use mirroring to build rapport. Repeat the last few words of their statement.                                                                                    | If someone says, "We're under pressure to close the deal," respond with, "You're under pressure?" to encourage them to elaborate.                                                                                                                                                  |                                            |
| **3. Don’t Feel Their Pain, Label It**                                  | Label emotions to make the other party feel understood. Use phrases like "It seems like...", "it sounds like,"" i feels like "<br><br>"What I am hearing is ..." | In salary negotiations: "It seems like you're worried about budget constraints." This builds trust.<br><br>---<br><br>"Look this might be harsh. and when I am done saying it, you might not like me at all! " -- preemptive approach to negative thinking.<br><br>---<br><br><br> | I am sure you have a good reason for this. |
| **4. Beware Yes, Master No**                                            | Getting a "No" is often more valuable than a fake "Yes." "No" creates security and control.                                                                      | Instead of asking, "Can we move forward?" ask, "Is now a bad time to discuss this?" to get an honest answer.                                                                                                                                                                       |                                            |
| **5. Trigger the Two Words That Immediately Transform Any Negotiation** | Getting the other party to say "That's right" means they feel understood. Avoid "You're right."                                                                  | A tenant negotiating rent says, "It seems like you want a responsible tenant who cares for the place." The landlord replies, "That's right."                                                                                                                                       |                                            |
| **6. Bend Their Reality**                                               | Use loss aversion to influence decisions. Anchor negotiations with an extreme first offer.                                                                       | A contractor quotes $50,000 for a job, then offers a “discount” to $40,000, making it seem like a good deal.                                                                                                                                                                       |                                            |
| **7. Create the Illusion of Control**                                   | Ask calibrated questions like "How am I supposed to do that?" to guide the other party's thinking.                                                               | In a business deal, instead of rejecting a low offer outright, ask, "How do you suggest I meet my costs with this price?"                                                                                                                                                          |                                            |
| **8. Guarantee Execution**                                              | Use "How" and "What" questions to get buy-in and ensure follow-through.                                                                                          | When finalizing a deal: "What does success look like for you?" to ensure alignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                            |
| **9. Bargain Hard**                                                     | Understand the three types of negotiators: Analysts, Accommodators, and Assertives. Adjust accordingly.                                                          | If negotiating with an Analyst, use logic and patience. With an Assertive, be direct and confident.                                                                                                                                                                                |                                            |
| **10. Find the Black Swan**                                             | Uncover hidden pieces of information (Black Swans) that can shift negotiations in your favor.                                                                    | A job candidate discovers the hiring manager needs to fill the position urgently, giving them leverage in salary talks.                                                                                                                                                            |                                            |
| **Conclusion: The Journey Ahead**                                       | Negotiation is a skill that can be learned and mastered through practice.                                                                                        | Practicing negotiations in daily life—buying a car, asking for a raise—helps improve skills.                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                            |
 

- people make decision =  
	- what they care about  / passionate about . => emotional process
	- understand it and feed it back to them
		- demonstrate that understanding => "being understood is more imporatnt than getting what they want (hypothesis)"
		- how they feel about things, how it drives them. --- tactical empathy
	- TACTICAL EMPATHY 
		- loss aversion   = fear of loss -- identify this and tactically diffuse this -- ADDRESS FEARS FIRST
		- LABELLING is best way to practice tactical empathy (more in table)
- Listeners JUDO
	- what they care about, what they are against.
	- REVEALing negatives : 
		- between lines
		- adjectives
		- positives -- flip side is negative (yin-yang)
			- e.g. if someone values integrity => betrayal is negative
