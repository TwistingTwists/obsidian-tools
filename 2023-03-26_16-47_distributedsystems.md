Basic intro.
1. Distributed system architectures: Different types of distributed system architectures, such as client-server, peer-to-peer, and hybrid models.

2. Consistency and replication: Techniques for maintaining consistency and replication of data across multiple nodes in a distributed system, including replication models, data consistency models, and quorums.

3. Distributed algorithms: Algorithms for distributed computing, such as distributed mutual exclusion, leader election, consensus, and distributed locking.

4. Fault tolerance: Techniques for ensuring fault tolerance in distributed systems, including redundancy, replication, and error recovery.

5. Networking and communication: Understanding the fundamentals of networking and communication protocols, including TCP/IP, HTTP, and RPC.

6. Security: Best practices for securing distributed systems, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.

7. Scalability: Techniques for designing and building scalable distributed systems, including load balancing, sharding, and horizontal scaling.

8. Cloud computing: Understanding cloud computing technologies and architectures, including public, private, and hybrid clouds, and how to design and deploy applications on cloud infrastructure.

9. Containerization and orchestration: Concepts related to containerization, such as Docker, and container orchestration, such as Kubernetes, to manage distributed systems.

10. Big Data: Understanding the concepts and technologies for processing, storing, and analyzing large volumes of data in a distributed system, including Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and NoSQL databases.
