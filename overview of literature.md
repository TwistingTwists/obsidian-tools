two answers to the question of filesystem snapshots - as a backup
1. cognition - devin does one - snapshotting the entire disk 
2. turso - sqlite as fs - agentfs 
3. object-native file system - juicefs (blob on s3 - juicefs interface and read and write) , archill (files appears as is on s3), 
4. s2 -> streams api - infinitie streams stored on s3
