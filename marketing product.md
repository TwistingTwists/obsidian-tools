#### How to discover what to build?

##### Ask more
- 10 calls / day
- People will be nice to you - they don't tell you in scrutiny what they need

##### Indicators
TL;DR: client pushing for the next steps. I want this right now.

- WEAK indicators
- yeah. interesting.
- Indications to look for in a call
- "I know someone in my org I want you to connect to?"
- Price? POV? when beta launch?

**POV = proof of value** 

>Get the courage to say that -- I don't understand what product are we selling?!

> We may be wrong. But we are not confused! 

##### Making POV

> Look for Pull from the other end

- I do want someone to be committed to the product (know what they WANT) before the product is built.
	- so asking a long list of questions => ensure that you are not pushing POV on them. They have to WANT it!! 

Corollary: If early customers are not pulling from you, later customers will not have a good time. (passion comes early)

##### Non-obvious fallacies

If the core team does not do it end-to-end (build -> market -> sales .... and so on), there is hardly anyone else you can bring in and they will be able to sell it. 
e.g. I will bring in a salesperson and he will be able to sell for me. 

##### Marketing challenge

- AWARENESS - challenge around awareness for the product
	- " Had they heard about me, they would have bought me! '' - clear POV 
- BRAND - At some point in growth of company - people are looking for a _brand_! - marketing

##### Understanding marketing

- CMO podcasts - Chief Marketing Officer? - What do they even do?

##### Lifecycle 

- growth of company - where the heat is 
	- intial - product kitchen - what to make
	- engg - make it work
	- sales - please sell it 
	- market - more pipeline to sales

B2B: build features for one client => increased complexity DIMENSION. 
- add one and remove one feature. Fight against entropy
- add according to customer needs, not customer wants

Marketing - What syncs with the community / audience + problem space
- (right blogs - funny, interesting) 
- live in the space as a customer
- GOAL - right people should hear right thing about my company - ASAP

CMO role 
- deep connection with core team + trust 
	- represent the core team to the world
		- easy to break the trust, hard to build trust
- Diverse job 
	- audience + role = performance marketing + events + design team

Person
 - it is ok to fail -- pretty sure I will fail at something
	 - and still attempting it
 - got in from mom - push yourself in new ways (face friction) + courage to try
	 - and it is ok to fail

product folks vs marketing folks
- product communication maybe slightly fuzzy.
- marketing has to be crystal clear - black and white.
	- message + amplify = CLEAR SIGNAL

Bubble
- messaging = for the audience. Not for you - you are inside the bubble.
- daily reminder pls

Ramp up in marketing, how?
- what are the companies really doing well? what are the brands I love? and what do I love about them?
- go find out what did the team do? Who were the people involved?

TRUST 
- how to build?
