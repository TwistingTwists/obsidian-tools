| templates / mastery in one framework is enough!                                          | it is not uncommon to devlier a project in a new programming lang in a month. you are a hacker. you make things work.                                                                                                                       |
| learn templates and you will be fine. driven by fear.<br><br>like ash / django framework | hacking your way around - no compression algorithm for hands on learning                                                                                                                                                                    |
| i will just read enough to get past by. no more effort is needed.                        | I read more to understand, get hands on with things to tinker with them.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| fast track course can help you land in maang / faang                                     | learning slow, with time is the only way to 'absorb' enough -- Felt this with DDIA. revise daily / discuss with folks                                                                                                                       |
| geneeralists don't know the 'tricks' of the trade. Specialists know thet tricks!         | tricks are important, and so is bastract thinking and the CRUX -- focusising on the big picture and picking right problem to solve.                                                                                                         |
| start up is luck gone right. you try and get something right.                            | as you try, develop the hunch / instinct to identify the crux right. it has three parts <br><br>1. most pressing issues<br>2. difficulty of those issues (can rank them)<br>3. ability to solve them                                        |

They have to adapt / improvise faster than anyone else.                                                                                                                                            |

No one else will do that for you. |
