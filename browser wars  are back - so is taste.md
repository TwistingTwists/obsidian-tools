Netscape and internet explorer wars during 2000s were there because they gave an ability to 'reach' and 'connect' with world wide web (www). It was won by distribution.

Today, browser wars are back. This time, agents want to 'connect' to www. 

By agents opearting in browser they can create experience for the user better when using the websites.

Continuing this thought, desktop apps that learn from user behaviour (RL?) and  the nudge user as per their intent would create 'experience' of the app. Taste (Taste1) matters more than ever here. And so does iteration. Which means the team with most shots at the problem (crafting user experience, here) wins. Which means having a great testing / iterating infra. 

Now, investing in rapid iteration also comes with taste and scars. Taste (Taste2) matters here more, for the impact.  Someone has 'wasted' time understanding what not to do. And testing infra avoids that - on scale. 

More importantly, testing infra is your ship -> steerable in wind, repairable, rebuildable with pieces that are easily available .
