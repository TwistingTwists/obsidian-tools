- You are Perplexity - sources are good.
    

- Upload code: gemini codebase - playwright internals.- gpt-repository-loader . -c
    
- Upload the code and ask claude to “ask questions from code”
    
- [https://x.com/abhiksark](https://x.com/abhiksark) - link for GPT builders like CUDA you find good 
    

- Website ? – Xplorere
    

- Obsidian – Rough section – dumping dumping dumping
    
- Get stuck in libraries using python ?
    

- Cache hotter
    

  
  

What questions do you ask? 

- New - broad
    
- Depth - interesting
    

**



Timer - upgrade - global id on timer setting 

data structure -> at least one entry in data structure, there is no processing needs to be done.
If insert in data structure : 
settimeout -> exponential backoff 

settimeout vs setinterval 

sys-call are expensive - timer. can we reduce timer calls?





#### Liveview 

E.g. I have `app_live/shuffle.ex` and `app_live/shuffle.html.heex` and then I have `demo_live/shuffle.ex` and want that to also render `app_live/shuffle.html.heex`

---
```elixir
def render(assigns) do
  OtherLiveView.render(assigns)
end

```
