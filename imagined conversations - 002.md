Here are some tips Google shares with managers on how to reflect on both the words and feelings heard during a conversation:

**Acknowledge emotion**

- “You seem frustrated/upset/happy about this.”

**Summarize what you’ve heard to ensure you understand, highlighting the key points**

- “It sounds like …”
- “In other words …”
- “So you are saying …”

**Use uncertainty to get clarification on the other’s frame of reference**

- “I’m not sure I understand, can you say more about …”
- “I think this is what you mean, is this accurate?”

**Respond with acceptance and empathy**

- “I see why this matters to you.”
- “I can understand why you’d feel that way.”
