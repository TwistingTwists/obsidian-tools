- Action: Initiate one cross-team problem-solving session without managers. Measure time-to-resolution.Here are key interview questions directly rooted in the Atlan Leadership Handbook 2025, organized by the cultural principles they test:

---

1. The Hierarchy Test: "Customer > Company > Team > Me"
Question: "Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision that benefited your customer but hurt your team's morale or your own career goals. What did you do and how did you communicate it?"

Answer in Book: Leaders must operationalize this hierarchy in every decision (pp. 3-4). The handbook explicitly states: "If you find less than 50% alignment with our values... it's better to find your true tribe than to fight against a company's fundamental DNA" (p. 2).

---

2. The "Pick Up the Broom" Test
Question: "Describe a situation where you had to do work that was 'beneath your title' to serve a customer or solve a critical problem. How did you handle it and what did your team learn from your example?"

Answer in Book: Leadership means literally sweeping the office before a customer visit or debugging code as a senior leader (pp. 40-41). "Your real role – everyone's real role – is guest relations. Everything else is just a way to serve that mission" (p. 41).

---

3. The High Trust vs. High Control Dilemma
Question: "Have you worked in a high-trust environment? How did you know trust existed, and what did you do when you saw a problem in another team that wasn't 'your responsibility'?"

Answer in Book: "At Atlan, every problem you see is your problem" (p. 45). The "Bystander's Dilemma" scenario explicitly rejects "not my place" thinking (p. 120). High trust means "problems belong to everyone who sees them, not just those officially responsible" (p. 45).

---

4. The "Dive Into Details" Test
Question: "Tell me about a time when staying surface-level on a project would have been easier, but you chose to go deep into the details. What changed because of that decision?"

Answer in Book: "Atlan leaders dive deep. This isn't optional... Never being satisfied with surface-level understanding" (p. 6). The anti-pattern is leaders who "don't dive deep into their team's work" (p. 88).

---

5. The "Sub-Optimal Decision" Test
Question: "Describe a time when you had imperfect information but had to make an irreversible (Type 2) decision. How did you gather signals, and how did you handle being wrong?"

Answer in Book: "The worst outcome isn't making a wrong decision – it's making a sub-optimal one" (p. 47). Type 2 decisions (irreversible like hiring) require extraordinary rigor, and "there is neither ego OR blowback ever associated with a decision being evolved" (p. 47).

---

6. The "Kind vs. Nice" Feedback Test
Question: "Tell me about the hardest piece of feedback you've given. How did you balance being direct with showing care, and what was the outcome?"

Answer in Book: "Kind leadership focuses on helping people grow... even when that means having uncomfortable conversations" (p. 71). "Nice leadership avoids difficult conversations to maintain harmony" (p. 71). The handbook emphasizes: "The biggest injustice... is keeping them on the team" when performance is lacking (p. 98).

---

7. The Global Remote Sacrifice Test
Question: "Working in a global company requires real sacrifices (early mornings, late nights, travel). Tell me about a time you had to choose between personal convenience and global team collaboration. How did you decide?"

Answer in Book: "When someone joins Atlan, they're choosing to accept these constraints" (p. 115). Leaders must "take team meetings at 7AM so their India colleagues can end their day earlier" (p. 115). "Save your 'get out of jail free' cards for true non-negotiables" (p. 110).

---

8. The "Talent Density" Ownership Test
Question: "What's your philosophy on hiring? Walk me through how you would design a hiring process that maintains an extremely high bar while creating an exceptional candidate experience."

Answer in Book: "Every leader owns their team's talent density" (p. 78). The handbook details a 27-interview funnel, hiring challenges, in-person evaluations, and "raising the tractor beam" for exceptional candidates (pp. 78-96). "There has never been a case at Atlan where someone did a mediocre challenge and ended up being exceptional on the job" (p. 93).

---

9. The "Crucial Conversation" Test
Question: "Tell me about a time you had to have a crucial conversation where stakes were high, opinions varied, and emotions were strong. How did you prepare and what was your framework?"

Answer in Book: Every crucial conversation needs "honesty, authenticity, true care, and inspires action" (p. 102). The "Anti-Pattern" sections warn against avoidant leaders, unclear communicators, and demotivating directors (p. 103).

---

10. The "Ikigai & Tours of Duty" Test
Question: "Tell me about a time when your personal career aspirations didn't align with what your company needed. How did you handle it, and what did you learn about sustainable growth vs. short-term ambition?"

Answer in Book: "Tours of Duty" require aligning personal growth with company needs (p. 129). The handbook explicitly rejects "career optics" over company success: "Your resume's worth will ultimately be determined by Atlan's success, not your title" (p. 125). Ikigai is about "where what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what sustains you intersect" (p. 84).

---

11. The "No-Gossip" Culture Test
Question: "Describe your team culture. What specifically did you do to prevent passive disagreement, back-channel conversations, and gossip?"

Answer in Book: "No Behind-the-Back Conversations" is a zero-tolerance policy (p. 107). "Passive disagreement is more damaging than active conflict" – eye rolls and muttered skepticism "erode trust without offering solutions" (p. 108).

---

12. The "Slope > Y-Intercept" Learning Test
Question: "How have you upgraded your leadership 'mech suit' in the last year? What specific feedback did you act on, and what did you change?"

Answer in Book: Leaders must understand "your growth rate (slope) matters more than where you start (y-intercept)" (p. 122). The Stripe metaphor: feedback about your laser blaster isn't about you, it's about upgrading components of your suit (p. 126). "Create active learning systems" (p. 122).

---

Key Insight: The handbook states these aren't theoretical questions – they're daily expectations. As one section warns: "If being liked by your team members is fundamentally important to you, leadership at Atlan might not be your path" (p. 73).






Here are 2-3 examples of answers a Software Engineering Manager could give for each test, based on the Atlan Leadership Handbook.
1. The Hierarchy Test
Question: "Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision that benefited your customer but hurt your team's morale or your own career goals. What did you do and how did you communicate it?"
 * Answer 1 (Customer Crisis): "Last quarter, a major customer had a critical, time-bound problem. My team was already tired from a long sprint, and this meant working over the weekend. Morale was a real concern. But the hierarchy is Customer > Team. I personally called the team, gave them full context on the customer's situation, and made it clear I'd be in the trenches working alongside them. We offered compensatory time off after delivery. It's a tough call, but the customer's problem had to be solved."
 * Answer 2 (Roadmap Change): "My team was incredibly excited to start a tech-debt refactor, which would have been great for morale ('Team') and my own goals ('Me'). But a new sales-cycle request came in for a feature that would unblock a major prospect ('Customer' / 'Company'). I had to make the call to delay our refactor. I explained to the team that while our internal work is important, it can't come at the expense of a customer outcome, and this decision was a direct application of our Customer > Company hierarchy."
2. The "Kind vs. Nice" Test
Question: "Imagine a member of your team is well-liked and a great cultural fit, but their performance is merely average and they're not meeting the high standards required. You've given them this feedback, but they get emotional and defensive. What do you do next?"
 * Answer 1 (The "Spinach" Analogy): "This is the 'spinach in the teeth' scenario. 'Nice' leadership would be to back off because they're emotional. 'Kind' leadership is having the awkward conversation anyway because I'm more invested in their long-term growth than their momentary comfort. I'd let them be emotional, but I would hold the standard and be direct about the performance gap, coming from a place of true care."
 * Answer 2 (Respect over Liked): "The handbook is clear that leaders must be willing to be respected, not just liked. Avoiding this conversation because of emotions is prioritizing my own comfort. My responsibility is to the team's high standards. I'd continue the crucial conversation, using specific examples, and frame it as helping them reach their potential, which is the 'kind' thing to do."
3. The "Sports Team vs. Family" Test
Question: "Tell me about a time you had to let go of someone who was a wonderful person and a great cultural fit, but wasn't performing at the level the team needed. If you haven't, walk me through how you would handle this."
 * Answer 1 (Injustice to the Team): "We are a 'championship team, not a family'. Keeping someone who isn't performing is an injustice to them and to the rest of the team who has to pick up the slack. I'd have the hard conversations early, and if performance didn't improve, I would manage their exit with dignity. It's 'selfishness disguised as kindness' to let them stay in a role where they aren't succeeding."
 * Answer 2 (Swiftness is Kind): "The handbook states that leaders almost always know in the first 1-2 weeks if someone isn't going to work out. Firing them at 6 months is a leadership failure. The kindest thing to do is act swiftly. If I let them go in the first 4 weeks, they don't even have to put Atlan on their resume. I would act fast, be direct, and be kind, knowing I'm helping them find their true tribe sooner."
4. The "Velocity & Ambition" Test
Question: "You've been given a target for your team that is incredibly ambitious. You currently have no clear visibility on how you'll achieve it, and the 'industry standard' timeline for such a goal is twice as long. How do you respond?"
 * Answer 1 (Rejecting Mediocrity): "My first thought is that 'industry standard' is often 'industry mediocrity'. We're told 'one Atlan year equals three human years'. I'd reject the 'time, cost, or quality - pick two' mentality. My job isn't to ask 'if' but 'what will it take?'. I'd start moving and 'create clarity through action' rather than wait for perfect visibility."
 * Answer 2 (Plant the Flag): "If the target is what the company needs, my job is to 'plant the flag' and find a way to deliver. The handbook is clear: 'If you have perfect visibility into how to achieve a target, we've probably set it too low'. I'd embrace the 'messy middle', work with the team to break down the problem, and adopt a 'can-do attitude' to figure it out."
5. The "Substance Over Optics" Test
Question: "Tell me about a project you led that was highly successful but received very little visibility or recognition. How did you feel about that, and how did you manage it with your team?"
 * Answer 1 (Impact Over Stories): "Atlan has an 'allergic reaction to the word "optics"'. If I'm worried about 'visibility,' I'm 'already thinking about the wrong thing'. The win is the impact. Did we solve the customer problem?. That's what I'd celebrate with my team. The handbook says 'real impact at Atlan doesn't need elaborate storytelling'."
 * Answer 2 (The Simple Formula): "My success isn't measured by visibility; it's measured by 'solve real problems, help others grow, deliver impact'. If the project was successful, we did that. I'd manage it by focusing the team on the substance—the customer who is now succeeding, the problem we solved. The handbook says the 'best stories... come from leaders who never thought about storytelling'."
6. The "Pick Up the Broom" Test
Question: "You're an engineering leader, and there is a critical customer-facing issue. The only way to solve it right now is for you to personally jump in and do several hours of debugging, which is a task far 'below' your job description. How do you handle this?"
 * Answer 1 (Direct Answer): "I do the debugging. The handbook gives this exact dilemma: 'As an engineering leader, I won't do debugging'. The resolution is 'no one is too senior to pick up the broom'. My title is about my scope of impact, not a 'symbol of status' that lets me avoid work. If it's what's needed for the customer, it's the job."
 * Answer 2 (Guest Relations): "My real role, everyone's real role, is 'guest relations'. Everything else, including my title, is just a way to serve that purpose. Refusing to debug is an 'anti-pattern of status'. Great leaders at Atlan lead through action; I'd pick up the broom and help the team solve the problem."
7. The "Pass the Ball" Test
Question: "You notice a critical flaw in another team's project that is going to impact the company, but it's 'not your job' and you're already overloaded. What do you do?"
 * Answer 1 (The Bystander's Dilemma): "This is 'The Bystander's Dilemma'. Thinking 'it's not my place' is the wrong mindset. The rule is 'every problem you see is your problem'. I have a responsibility to act. I'd 'start from trust' and assume the other team is missing context I have. I'd raise the issue directly and offer to help, not criticize."
 * Answer 2 (Zero Tolerance for Blame): "Atlan has 'zero tolerance for cross-functional blame'. If I see that flaw and do nothing, I 'share ownership of that failure'. The handbook says we don't 'pass the buck'; we 'pass the ball'. I'd flag the issue, focus on the solution, not the blame, and help the whole team win."
8. The "Hiring Challenge" Test
Question: "You've found a 'perfect' senior candidate. They have a stellar resume from top companies. In the final stage, they push back on doing the hiring challenge, saying their resume speaks for itself and they're too busy. How do you proceed?"
 * Answer 1 (The Great Equalizer): "I hold the line. The challenge is our 'Great Equalizer'. It's how we test for outcomes, not pedigree. I'd explain that everyone at Atlan, including senior leaders, has done a challenge. It's our 'best predictor of on-the-job performance'. If they're not willing to do it, they're not a fit, regardless of their resume."
 * Answer 2 (The Fundamental Truth): "I would not hire them. The handbook is blunt: 'There has never been a case at Atlan where someone did a mediocre challenge and ended up being exceptional on the job. Never'. If a candidate won't even do the challenge, that's a massive red flag. As a hiring manager, I am responsible for talent density, and I can't compromise the bar."
📝 How to Test and Improve Your Awareness
Here is a short, scannable guide with action items to self-assess your alignment with these principles and track your growth.
1. How to Test Your Current Awareness (Audit)
 * The Dilemma Audit: For one week, keep a "Dilemma Log." Every time you face a conflict between Customer, Company, Team, or Me, write it down and be brutally honest about which one you actually chose. This tests your Hierarchy alignment.
 * The "Avoided Conversation" List: At the end of the week, list all the "kind" conversations (feedback, performance) you avoided because you felt it would be awkward or make someone emotional. This is your "Nice vs. Kind" gap.
 * The "Broom" Scan: Walk through your team's work (e.g., code reviews, design docs, support tickets). How many times did you stay at the 10,000-foot level vs. "diving deep" into the actual work?. This tests your "Pick Up the Broom" and "Dive Deep" alignment.
 * The "Blame" Test: Think of the last cross-functional problem. Did you privately or publicly blame the other team?. Or did you immediately ask, "How can my team help solve this?". Be honest.
2. How to Improve and Measure Progress (Action)
 * Schedule "Kindness": Put 30 minutes on your calendar every Friday to review your "Avoided Conversation" list. Your action item is to schedule and have at least one of those "kind" conversations the following Monday. Progress = Your list of avoided talks gets shorter.
 * Appoint a "Hierarchy" Keeper: In your next team meeting when debating priorities, explicitly ask one person to be the "Hierarchy Keeper" who has to call out if the debate is violating the Customer > Company > Team > Me principle. Progress = Your team starts making faster, more aligned decisions.
 * Track Your "Broom" Actions: Create a simple tracker. Column 1: Problem I Saw (Not "My Job"). Column 2: What I Did (Passed the buck vs. Passed the ball). Your goal is to have 100% of items in Column 2 read "Passed the ball" or "Picked up the broom".
 * Ask for "Mech Suit" Feedback: The handbook suggests your leadership style is a "mech suit" you can upgrade. Once a month, ask one peer and one direct report: "What is one thing I should stop doing to be a more effective leader?". Progress = You can hear the feedback without defensiveness and can list the changes you've made based on it.











Here are tailored answers for software engineering managers, followed by a self-assessment framework:

---

1. The Hierarchy Test
Q: Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision that benefited your customer but hurt your team's morale or your own career goals.

Example Answers:
- "Our enterprise client needed a custom API integration in 2 weeks that required my team to scrap a sprint. I took the hit: I personally worked nights/weekends, shielded my team from the worst of it, and we delivered. The client renewed for 3 years. My promotion got delayed because I missed internal KPIs that quarter, but I modeled what 'Customer > Me' actually means."
- "A customer bug was trending on Twitter. My team was building a feature I needed for my performance review. I redeployed the team, we fixed it in 4 hours, then I explained to leadership why my goals slipped. The customer success team sent us a direct thank-you video from the CTO that I showed my team—that became their morale boost, not the feature."
- "I removed myself from the promotion pipeline to advocate for my team's budget to fix technical debt that was slowing down a Fortune 500 customer. I told my manager: 'My promotion can wait; their SLA can't.' Six months later, that customer doubled their contract, and leadership promoted me anyway for showing ownership."

---

2. The "Pick Up the Broom" Test
Q: Describe a situation where you had to do work "beneath your title" to serve a customer or solve a critical problem.

Example Answers:
- "As an engineering manager, I debugged a P1 outage at 2 AM that turned out to be a DNS misconfiguration. My senior engineer was burned out. I screenshared from my phone while on a family vacation, fixed it in 20 minutes, then documented the fix in our wiki at 3 AM. The next day, I told my team: 'Never assume you're above the work.'"
- "Our junior engineer was struggling with a complex React bug that was blocking a customer demo. I spent 3 hours pair-programming with them, not just watching but actually typing alongside them. We fixed it, and they told me later that was the moment they felt safe to ask for help. Leadership isn't abdicating the keyboard."
- "I cleaned up our lab environment and refilled coffee for a customer workshop because our ops person called in sick. The customer saw me doing it and said: 'That's how I know your company actually cares.' My team now takes ownership of the office space because they saw me literally pick up the broom."

---

3. The High Trust vs. High Control Dilemma
Q: Have you worked in a high-trust environment? How did you know trust existed, and what did you do when you saw a problem in another team?

Example Answers:
- "At my last startup, we had a 'no PR approval needed for hotfixes' policy. That trust was earned: when I saw the mobile team's API causing latency for my web team, I didn't file a ticket—I walked over, paired with their engineer for 2 hours, and we shipped a fix together. No meetings, no blame. The lead thanked me for 'passing the ball, not the buck.'"
- "High trust means my director let me hire without his final approval because I'd proven my bar. When I noticed the infra team's deployment pipeline was breaking our builds, I didn't escalate—I joined their standup, offered to help refactor their Jenkins scripts, and we co-owned the solution. Trust = I could see their problem as my problem."
- "We measured trust by how quickly bad news traveled. When I saw the QA team was burning out and cutting corners, I didn't gossip—I invited their manager to coffee, shared my observations with data, and offered two of my engineers to help automate their tests. High trust means no 'your team/my team'—just 'our customer.'"

---

4. The "Dive Into Details" Test
Q: Tell me about a time when staying surface-level would have been easier, but you chose to go deep into the details.

Example Answers:
- "My team was building a microservice and wanted to use a new database. Instead of rubber-stamping it, I spent a weekend reading the source code, found a critical bug in their transaction handling, and had them switch. The CTO later told me that decision saved us a 500K outage. I earned their respect by diving deep, not coasting on my title."
- "A junior engineer's PR looked fine at a glance, but I pulled the branch and ran it locally. I found a race condition that would have caused 1% of users to see corrupted data. I paired with them for 4 hours to fix it and write a test. They told me: 'I thought you were just going to approve it because you're busy.'"
- "We had a mysterious memory leak in production. I could have delegated, but I spent 3 days profiling heap dumps, learning Rust's memory model, and discovered we were cloning massive data structures. The fix took 2 lines. My team's velocity doubled after that because they saw their manager would do the gritty work."

---

5. The "Sub-Optimal Decision" Test
Q: Describe a time when you had imperfect information but had to make an irreversible (Type 2) decision.

Example Answers:
- "I had to decide whether to hire a senior engineer with a great resume but yellow flags on collaboration. I gathered 5 backchannel references, found a pattern of territorial behavior, and rejected them despite pressure to fill the role. Three months later, we found someone better. The cost of a sub-optimal hire is 10x the cost of waiting."
- "We needed to choose a cloud provider before our Series B. I had 48 hours. I wrote a 1-page decision doc with assumptions, risks, and a 90-day checkpoint. We chose AWS. At 90 days, we discovered our workload was cheaper on GCP—so I publicly admitted my mistake and we migrated. No ego, just optimal decisions."
- "My team wanted to adopt a new framework. I knew it was Type 2 (irreversible). I made them run a 2-week spike, present to the entire engineering org, and get 3 dissenting opinions before I approved. It delayed us by a month, but the scrutiny ensured it was optimal, not just popular."

---

6. The "Kind vs. Nice" Feedback Test
Q: Tell me about the hardest piece of feedback you've given. How did you balance directness with care?

Example Answers:
- "I had an engineer who was brilliant but toxic in code reviews—publicly shaming juniors. I told them: 'Your technical skills are top 5%, but your behavior is bottom 50%. If this doesn't change in 30 days, I'll remove you from the team. I'll help you, but I will not sacrifice the team's psychological safety.' They changed. They're now a staff engineer."
- "A senior engineer on my team wasn't coding anymore—just architecture meetings. I said: 'I see you as a player-coach. Right now, you're only coaching. Your team is losing respect because they see you're not in the code with them. I need you to ship 3 features this quarter, or we'll discuss a different role.' They stepped up."
- "I had to fire an engineer who was trying hard but couldn't meet our bar. I spent 6 hours over 2 weeks helping them find a new role elsewhere, practice interviews, and even connected them to a company where they'd thrive. Kind = I want you to succeed, even if it's not here. Nice would have been letting them flounder for another year."

---

7. The Global Remote Sacrifice Test
Q: Working globally requires sacrifices. Tell me about a time you chose between personal convenience and global team collaboration.

Example Answers:
- "I'm in SF; my team is in Bangalore. I blocked 7-9 AM daily for 'AST' (Atlan Standard Time) and told my family I'd miss breakfast with them. I also blocked 6-8 PM twice a week for optional deep work with my night-owl engineers. My wife wasn't thrilled, but I explained: 'This is the cost of building a global championship team.' I make it up by being fully present on weekends."
- "I was on vacation in Hawaii when our customer in Germany had a P1. It was 4 AM my time. I joined the war room, not to micromanage, but to unblock decisions and show the customer we cared. I then slept 4 hours, spent the day with my family, and did a handoff at 10 PM. The customer renewed because they saw we never clock out on them."
- "I moved my entire team's standup to 6:30 AM Pacific so our India team could end their day by 8 PM IST. I lost an hour of sleep, but my team's talent density increased because we could hire the best people in India, not just those willing to burn out. That's picking 'Company > Me.'"

---

8. The "Talent Density" Ownership Test
Q: Walk me through how you'd design a hiring process that maintains an extremely high bar while creating an exceptional candidate experience.

Example Answers:
- "I design a 4-hour take-home challenge that mirrors our actual codebase. I personally review every submission, spending 30-60 minutes on each. I send personalized feedback to every candidate, even rejected ones. One candidate I rejected tweeted about our process—got us 10 more applicants. High bar + high care = flywheel."
- "I calibrate by interviewing 5 exceptional people in my network before opening a req. I ask them to do our challenge so I know what 'great' looks like. I then involve 2 engineers, 1 designer, and 1 PM in every onsite—cross-functional evaluation. We've rejected 20 candidates who met every skill but failed our 'no-gossip' culture screen. Talent density > speed."
- "I run the hiring funnel like a product: I track conversion rates, drop-off points, and candidate NPS. When I saw senior engineers dropping after the challenge, I added a 15-minute pre-challenge call to explain why it matters. Our completion rate went from 60% to 85%. The bar stayed high; the experience got human."

---

9. The "Crucial Conversation" Test
Q: Tell me about a time you had a crucial conversation where stakes were high, opinions varied, and emotions were strong.

Example Answers:
- "My team wanted to rewrite our monolith in microservices; I thought it was premature. I scheduled a 2-hour debate where I forced them to argue against microservices and me for it. We flipped roles. They realized the ops overhead; I saw their scaling pain. We compromised: extract one service first. The process built trust because we attacked the problem, not each other."
- "A top-performing engineer was bypassing code review for speed. I told them: 'You're costing us trust. One more time, and I remove your merge access. This isn't about you—it's about the 5 juniors who think rules don't apply to stars.' They got it. We created a 'fast-track review' process for them to mentor others instead."
- "I had to tell my director that his pet project was killing team morale. I brought data: 40% of our sprint was his 'experiments,' and our customer bug fix rate dropped 60%. I said: 'I respect your vision, but your method is breaking the team. Let's find another way.' He killed the project. It was tense, but I earned his respect for speaking truth."

---

10. The "Ikigai & Tours of Duty" Test
Q: Tell me about a time when your personal career aspirations didn't align with what your company needed.

Example Answers:
- "I wanted to manage a 20-person team, but the company needed me to be an IC staff engineer to fix our data pipeline crisis. I took the Tour of Duty, spent 6 months in the trenches, and shipped a system that processed 10B events/day. After, they gave me a 15-person team and a staff title. The company remembers who says yes."
- "My career plan was frontend architect, but we lost our backend lead. I told my manager: 'I'll own the backend for 12 months, but I need you to commit to rotating me back to frontend after.' He agreed. I built a team, shipped our API platform, and at 12 months, he made me full-stack architect—better than my original plan."
- "I was a manager but realized I missed coding. The company needed a strong IC in ML infrastructure. I stepped down from management (worried about optics), spent a year shipping models, and now I'm a Staff ML Engineer with more influence than I had as a manager. My resume says 'Staff'—the tour was the best career move I made."

---

11. The "No-Gossip" Culture Test
Q: Describe your team culture. What specifically did you do to prevent passive disagreement and gossip?

Example Answers:
- "I instituted a rule: venting must end with an action. If someone complained about another team, I'd ask: 'What will you do about it?' If they said 'nothing,' I'd say: 'Then don't waste energy complaining.' It killed gossip instantly. People either solved it or stayed quiet."
- "In our Slack, we have a #no-stupid-questions channel where I post my own mistakes weekly. When someone passive-aggressively eye-rolled about our QA team in a meeting, I stopped and said: 'Let's say that directly to them. I'll set up the meeting for you.' They apologized. The behavior stopped."
- "I modeled it: when a PM told me privately they thought my engineer's estimate was inflated, I pulled both into a room and said: 'Talk this through now. I'll moderate.' The PM learned the complexity, the engineer learned to explain better, and they built trust. No scar tissue."

---

12. The "Slope > Y-Intercept" Learning Test
Q: How have you upgraded your leadership "mech suit" in the last year? What feedback did you act on?

Example Answers:
- "My team told me I was 'a helicopter manager'—always hovering. I got a coach, set up a weekly 1:1 with my director for feedback, and now I do 'no-meeting Wednesdays' where I don't check code or Slack. My team's velocity increased 30%. The feedback was a gift; I treated it as upgrading my suit, not attacking me."
- "A peer told me my code reviews were too harsh—engineers were scared to merge. I recorded myself reviewing and counted my negative comments: 85% critical. I rewrote my style to include 3 positives per negative, added 'appreciation comments,' and now my team merges 2x faster. I was crushing their confidence, not raising the bar."
- "I realized I was avoiding learning Rust because I was 'a manager now.' I spent 3 months building a side project in Rust, blogged about my failures, and now I can actually assess my team's technical decisions. My 'y-intercept' was high as a former Python expert, but my slope was flat. That had to change."

Self-Assessment & Improvement Framework

How to Test Your Current Level

Scorecard Audit (Rate 1-5 for each):
1. Hierarchy Living: When's the last time you chose customer/company over your team/me? Check your calendar: How many hours this week were spent on internal politics vs. customer-impacting work?
2. Broom Moments: How many times this month did you do IC-level work to unblock your team? If zero, you're too removed.
3. Trust Metrics: Count how many cross-team problems you solved without involving managers. If you're waiting for permission, you don't trust yet.
4. Details Depth: Can you explain your team's top 3 technical risks right now? Not from a report—from memory, with specifics?
5. Decision Quality: Look at your last 5 irreversible decisions. How many times did you change your mind based on new data? Zero = ego problem.
6. Feedback Frequency: Count your "crucial conversations" this quarter. If it's less than 1 per direct report, you're being nice, not kind.
7. Global Empathy: How many times have you taken a call at an inconvenient time without complaining? Your team sees your sacrifice.
8. Hiring Bar: Of your last 10 candidates, how many did you reject despite pressure to fill the role? If <30%, you're compromising.
9. Gossip Detection: Ask your team: "Where have you seen me shut down passive disagreement?" If they can't answer, you're not modeling it.
10. Learning Velocity: What new technical or leadership skill have you demonstrated in the last 3 months? Not read about—actually done.

Action Items to Measure Progress

Week 1: Baseline
- Action: Ask your team: "On a scale of 1-10, how much do you see me living 'Customer > Company > Team > Me'?" Average = your score.
- Action: Record yourself in a meeting. Count how many times you say "I think" vs. "What does the customer need?"
- Measure: Track your time: % spent on customer-impacting work vs. internal process.

Month 1: Behavioral Shifts
- Action: Do one "broom" task weekly (debug, doc, deploy). Document it in a public Slack channel. Track team engagement increase.

- Action: Have one "kind, not nice" conversation per week. Follow up: Did they improve? Did they thank you later?
- Measure: Net Promoter Score from your team: "How likely are you to recommend me as a leader?" Track weekly.

Quarter 1: Systemic Changes
- Action: Redesign your hiring process: Add a challenge, calibrate with 5 external experts, track candidate NPS. Target: 80+ NPS, <10% offer rate.
- Action: Create a "no-gossip" team norm. First violation: public reminder. Second: 1:1 crucial conversation. Third: removal. Track violations.
- Action: Take 3 calls in "AST" (Atlan Standard Time) at personal inconvenience. Don't mention it. See if your India team starts mirroring your behavior.
- Measure: Technical audit: Can you explain your team's architecture to a new hire without preparation? Record yourself. If >3 "ums," you need to dive deeper.

Ongoing: Learning Velocity
- Action: Publish one "mech suit upgrade" per month: blog about a mistake, teach a lunch-and-learn on a new skill, or ask for feedback publicly.
- Action: Find a "thought partner" outside your chain of command. Weekly 30-min call to pressure-test your decisions. Track decisions changed.
- Measure: Slope > Y-Intercept metric: Rate your own learning velocity monthly. If it's flat for 2 months, you're falling behind Atlan's pace.

Red Flags: You're Failing
- You haven't touched code in 6 months.
- Your team only brings you good news.
- You've never changed your mind publicly.
- You can't name your top performer's low-energy tasks.
- You've compromised on a hire because "we needed someone fast."
- You think "managing up" is part of your job.

Green Flags: You're Succeeding
- Your team gives you unsolicited feedback.
- You rejected a candidate who met all skills but failed culture fit.
- You've taken a 6 AM call and didn't tell anyone.
- You've publicly admitted a wrong decision and changed course.
- Your engineers are solving cross-team problems without you.

Final Test: Ask your team: "If I got hit by a bus tomorrow, what would you remember me for?" If the answer is "your title" or "your meetings," you're not leading Atlan's way. If it's "the time you debugged with me at midnight" or "the hard conversation that made me better," you're building the culture this handbook demands.
