## Questions: 

- is the format Day book - fixed? always same? 
- how to build a daily book? 
- What is a day book? 
- What is common sense?
	- What is "ledge of legal expense" - if a client asks for a "Ledger of Legal Expenses," they aren't just looking for a list of costs—they want to know **what was billed, what was paid, and what is still owed.**
		- common mistake - An AI should "know" that to give a complete picture of an expense, it must cross-reference the Vendor ledger. Simply listing debits without corresponding credits (payments) makes the ledger useless for reconciliation.

### vishal logs 
I asked 2 questions.

1. Ledger of a legal expenses. At first it gave me only expense details without the payment. This is because payments are not directly related to an expense but to a vendor. So that function is not available in Tally either. But ChatGPT did a poor job of preparing the ledger. And it also did not link the payments. Basically, the "common sense" was missing

2. Balance sheet as on 31-Mar-2022. Here ChatGPT failed miserably. The bank balance as on date was Rs. 22 Cr, and there were other assets as well. The total assets calculated by ChatGPT was only Rs. 8 Cr

But more importanly, the figures given by ChatGPT were not auditable. The only way to audit them was to have a conversation with the model, which is not conduicive for audit. For audit I need to go back to my original question several times and need to go back and forth between questions. It becomes clumsy in a long conversation format.
